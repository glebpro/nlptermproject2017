When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.\n\nI'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.\n\nI also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.\n\nAs of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.\n\nI'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as \"vegan\" as possible in the future (I hate this whole \"vegan\" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.\n\nI know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.\n\nOn the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...\n\nFor me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.\n\nI still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.\n\n**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**\n\n&gt; Eventually \u2014 not soon, but maybe in a generation or two \u2014 I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.\n\nI have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.\n\n**Another great argument with links**\n\n&gt; In short, the reality is: It adds up.  \n[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)  \n[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)  \nBoth of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds. They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability.  \nIn other words, they ask questions like, \"What are the odds that your purchase of, say, a frozen turkey will be the one that causes your grocery store to order another entire shipment of frozen turkeys? And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys? And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys?\"\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While heterosexuals students may get beaten up a lot less on average, I'm sure we could identify groups within heterosexuals that should be protected from bullying, (e.g. nerds).  \n\nObviously adding nerds to the list of protective classes is ridiculous.  The LGBTQ community is considerably more organized and properly defined, they've banded together and pushed serious change in policy in the last decade.

{"title": "CMV: Nicki Minaj is in the wrong, not Miley.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3j8bhs", "selftext": "I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know about this whole thing until this morning. I saw a whole bunch of posts on tumblr like \"I hate Miley so much,\" \"Miley needs to check her white privilege,\" \"I respect Nicki so much for how she handled that.\"\n\nSo I went on ye olde Google and in ten seconds found the transcript of the Miley interview, and I video of their exchange at the VMAs. So to recap, Anaconda didn't get nominated for best video, Nicki went on Twitter and basically said that it didn't get nominated because she's a curvy black woman and implied that if she were a skinny white girl like tailor swift (she never said nor implicated tailor, but tailor took it to mean her because she is a good example) she would have been nominated. Miley then says in an interview that she could have respected what Nicki said if it was said in a different less angry way, but couldn't because of the way she presented her points. She called Nicki \"not polite\" and \"not very nice\" in her statements about the nominations. Then during the VMAs Nicki said \"back to the bitch that had a lot to say about me in the press a few days ago\" then said something along the lines of \"what you got.\" Miley then said, \"we are all in the same industry, we all do interviews, we all know how they manipulate things, congratulations on your award.\"\n\nFrankly before this incident I respected Nicki way more than Miley, but I've lost some respect for Nicki and gained some for Miley.\n\nI think Miley's comments to the press were respectful, articulate, and accurate. I think she handled the VMA situation maturely.\n\nI think Nicki's comments on Twitter came across as petty, and I also think they were inaccurate. I think the way she handled the VMAs was immature and only served to detract from her point by diminishing her credibility.\n\nI also feel like Nicki and Beyonc\u00e9 are two strong examples of non white women who are both celebrated for their contributions to the music industry and are regarded widely as extremely sexy. For this reason, I think that people calling it \"body shaming\" that Nicki wasn't nominated is ridiculous. She's a pop star and sex symbol, nobody is body shaming her, and if they are, not nominating her for an award doesn't count. I also feel like it makes sense that there aren't as many black women who are famous and receiving awards because, well, there are way fewer black women than black men, white men, white women, and all other gender ethnicity  combinations combined. Statistically it's completely reasonable for there to be years where an award with fewer than ten nominees have no black female nominees.\n\nI do think Nicki has a point that black women and black men contribute a lot to pop culture and aren't recognized for it, but I think they aren't recognized because it's the average black person that creates more culture than a few celebs. We don't give out awards for \"segment of the population that most contributed to pop culture this year.\"\n\nI'm willing to award deltas both for objective proof that black women specifically are snubbed in the music industry (no subjective \"this video was clearly better\" nonsense), and for persuading me that Nicki's comments at the VMAs were justified/Miley was in the wrong in the situation in terms of the way she approached the problem."}

{"title": "CMV: We Should execute the weak to improve the human genepool and reduce overpopulation", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3j5b7g", "selftext": "\n_____\n\nAlright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.\nI believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.\nYou look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.\nNow to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.\nWhat will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.\nWhat the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.\nHow we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.\nNow another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.\nI would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.\nThis is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view."}
{"title": "CMV: He, she, they. That's all the pronouns you are getting.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3j4xz5", "selftext": "My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is \"xe/xer/xerself\" or \"zi/zis/zimself\". My argument is as follows:\n\n1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A \"he\" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.\n2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.\n3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. \n4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Deus Ex is a niche but brilliant series and it wouldn't take much for the series to go back to sleep for another decade (if not permanently) due to lack of sales. So i have a choice.

He doesn't really have any strong theological beliefs (he's \"agnotistic\") but he believes there will always be more to our reality than what can be measured -- and, by extension, doesn't find it absurd for someone to believe in life after death. No matter what we learn about physics and the human brain, there could always be \"more out there\" that in some way would allow our being to persist even after death. This beliefs spills over into more practical matters, such as him refusing to see any computer as ever being \"conscious,\" regardless of it's complexity. \n\nI argue that we know enough in this modern age to dismiss that belief. We may not really understand how all the neurons on our brain work together to make a fully formed human mind, but we know it's an emergent property of physical parts -- and no more. We're a sac of complicated flesh that uses electrical gradients to process information. If one part of the brain is physically damaged, the processing that occurs in that area of the brain is disrupted. People have strokes and lose a huge chunk of their \"personhood.\" Maybe they have trouble speaking, or recognizing faces, or maybe their personality is drastically altered. Regardless, it's clear that we're the product of PHYSICAL interactions in the brain. We don't exist anywhere else in any sense -- we are literally the structure of our neurons. It may be a black box, but just because we don't know how the black box functions doesn't mean there might be an entirely different reality out there that would allow our true \"soul\" to move to or extend from. It's just human arrogance to believe we're special in some way and can transcend this universe full of non-living parts. \n\nHe also believes that we could be living in the Matrix, for instance, and that might be one way for life after death to occur. He says that I'm the arrogant one for claiming with certainty that we shouldn't believe in things beyond the measurable.\n\n\n\nEdit: It seems like my main criticism is that claiming something with certainty (no afterlife) is inherently more ignorant that at least admitting something to be a possibility.\n\nI'll try to rephrase. If we're abiding by a philosophical absolute sense of certainty, then anything is possible. The matrix is possible, god is possible... maybe there's only one sentient person on the planet and the rest are robots in disguise. You can't construct some logical proof to dismiss these ideas as being utterly impossible.\n\nBut where does this leave us? We can't know ANYHTHING, then? \nJust because all of our knowledge of the universe is acquired through inductive reasoning doesn't mean we can hold on to these irrational beliefs. We study the microscopic world that composes us, observe that everything seems to operate on static laws. We're composed of the very stuff we study, so, conclusion: we operate on the same static laws. If a 100 years from now we understand the brain in depth, and from static principles can explain how a given structure of neurons can give rise to a certain personality or behavior, then where will you put your theological beliefs? If we can be explained via rules in this world, why would i need to believe in anything more?\n\n\nEDIT: I guess this entire discussion is about materialism. I'm a physicist at heart. I still view materialism / physicalism as the only reasonable philosophical position, but I'll retract the notion that people who believe otherwise are actually \"stupid.\" \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Trump is the everyman's candidate", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3j3rdy", "selftext": "A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls.  The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  \n\nAfter realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.\n\nAm I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?\n\n***EDIT****\nFrom todays conversations:\nI see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.\n\nHowever, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.\n\nMany (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.\n\nIf he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Planned Parenthood should spin off it's abortion business and then re-brand it's health services business lines", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3j3nfq", "selftext": "Planned Parenthood is a non-profit, but it is still a business.  Businesses spin off business lines all the time for any variety of reasons.\n\nSince their abortion business line receives no taxpayer funds, there shouldn't be any financial loss from spinning it off into a new business.  Then all the other health services that Planned Parenthood provides could be conducted free from the stigma of being provided by \"America's largest abortion provider\".\n\nSuch a move would direct any criticism and protests to the new \"abortion only\" business and away from the health services businesses.  They would no longer face threats of cuts to their federal funding.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were actually able to increase their funding with such a move.\n\nThe biggest challenge I can think of that would be faced would be the need for additional locations since all existing locations would have to be designated as either \"abortion services\" or \"health services\" locations.  But I don't think that would be a HUGE obstacle.\n\nMany of the existing locations could likely be split into two separate, but side-by-side, facilities.  Many are in buildings that could easily be divided for multiple tenants already, so that's exactly what would be happening.  Opening new \"free health clinics\" should be fairly easy from a local regulatory standpoint.  Who wouldn't want more free health clinics in their neighborhood?  \n\nAnd if the total square footage needed for both abortion and healthcare services shouldn't change much (maybe a little more space for 2 reception desks and waiting rooms), so the long-term increase in rental or real estate costs shouldn't be significant.  I think it would more than offset by increased revenue from greater public support, and reduced costs related to security and dealing with protests.\n\nThe only other caveat of this view is that I'm taking Planned Parenthood's contention that no federal funds are used in the abortion business at face value.  I have no reason not to believe that.  But if that isn't true, it would present additional challenges to any spinoff."}

{"title": "CMV: Gun Control groups should drop the Assault Weapon rhetoric and focus on what really causes the most violence: Handguns", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3j345v", "selftext": "Everytime the topic of Gun Control comes up, be it on the internet, on the news or in person, it seems to me that these this point dominates the conversation. And frankly, nothing screams 'I don't know what I'm talking about' more than someone who keeps insisting that 'assault weapons' are the problem (or even *a* problem for that matter).\n\nAre you an individual who is against 'assault weapons?'  If so, here's a fun self-awareness test.\n\n**What is an Assault Weapon?**\n\nDon't Google it, just try and answer it for yourself.  If you're like most anti-gun types, you have absolutely no idea what it actually means.  I ask people this question plain and simple all the time and they get completely screwed up.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, **assault weapon** as a term used in the gun control discussion is completely made up.  For a rifle to suddenly become an 'Assault Rifle,'  all you need to do is add **cosmetic additions** that don't change the functionality of the weapon **at all**.\n\n[Here's an example of what I'm talking about](http://moelane.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/718415097.jpg)\n\nAlright, so we've established that the 'assault weapon' term is silly.  Now, let's look at what is actually killing people.  \n\n[Here's some numbers on homicide weapons](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8)\n\nAs you can see, handguns are OVERWHELMINGLY used more than rifles ('assault weapons'). Rifles are used less than blunt objects!\n\nBut I know everyone gets worked up over **mass shootings**.  That's what's terrorizing our country, right?\n\nWell, take a look at this Mother Jones [chart](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data)\n\nThe weapons used are, again, OVERWHELMINGLY handguns!\n\nSo why is there is big outrage against AR-15s and other semiautomatic rifles again?\n\nNow for my personal interpretation of this data.  I conclude that the polticians behind gun control laws don't actually care about reducing violence.  They rely on the ignorance of their voting base when it comes to firearm functionality and homocide statistics. As such, they pass laws that don't actually ruffle the Gun Lobby's feathers too much, because the cosmetic items don't really matter.\n\nHell, I wouldn't even be surprised if this is exactly what PRO-gun lobbyists are pushing behind the scenes. Anyone who educates themselves for a few seconds on Google can see that 'Assault Weapon' bans are entirely superficial and do nothing to curb violence, which makes the Gun Control crowd look more ignorant as a whole.\n\nWelp, that's about it. Go ahead and take a shot at my view!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In the same way, I would call blue eyes and homosexuality an abnormality. None of which, in this day an age, negatively impact these people's outlook of life and how happily they could live their lives (ignoring reactions from social responses of being transgender/gay/blue eyes). My flow of logic is as follows:\n\nAn abnormality is something that differs from what is usually observed in any life form.\n\nIf in a perfect world, all humans primarily use right hands over left, then a left handed person would be abnormal but still able to live just as easily as any right handed person.\n\nIf in this nonperfect world, a life form's goal is ultimately to survive and procreate for future generations; then something that inhibits this primal goal would be a negative change.\n\nLiving in the world that we do, our goal as a species is not to procreate as much as possible, because we do not require it for survival of the species. More so the goal changes simply to be as happy as we can be.\n\nIf a human who lived in our early stages as humans was 100% homosexual in a world mostly heterosexual, a homosexual would have difficulty passing their genes along to future generations.\n\nIn early stages of human life, homosexuality was a negative change from normality because it disallowed the life form to bare more life.\n\nIn 2015, homosexuality is not a negative change because procreation is not a fundamental goal, whereas happiness is. \n\nTherefore, being homosexual is no longer a negative change, simply an abnormality.\n\nBeing transgender is a 'disagreement' between mind and body.\n\nIn early stages of human life, a human that thought it was not human (ie: a plant or a fish) would have a very difficult time achieving it's specie's fundamental goals.\n\nIn 2015, we no longer have these fundamental goals, because instead, being comfortable and happy is what we desire.\n\nA homosexual or transgender is a person with an abnormality that at a point in time would negatively impact their ability to survive and procreate, but has 'no' impact on their ability to be happy.\n\nAlso, I would say if modernism has a way to remedy the abnormality to allow the abnormal being to still be happy, then it ought to be remedied. \n\nThe easiest way to change modernism to allow all peoples to be happy is to change our view of how we perceive them; in a similar way we do not hate people with retardations; because in a point in time it was okay to allow those who cannot survive and procreate to die off. But as I have said, ability to survive is not something we restrict happiness to. \n\nIf a person 'chooses' (or not chooses) to live happily in a way that defies the necessities of survival that person ought to be respected nonetheless. \n\nBut social variations that directly go against how we were 'designed' to live are abnormalities.\n\nA transgender person is abnormal, but not lesser.\n\nA homosexual person is abnormal, but not lesser.\n\nA blue eyed person is abnormal, but not lesser.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Trying to save the pandas is a waste of time, money, and resources. We should let them go extinct.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3izepf", "selftext": "First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:\n  \n1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   \n  \n2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   \n  \n3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  \n  \n4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow."}
{"title": "CMV: The hyper-rationality of our age is detrimental to humans.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3iz617", "selftext": "Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring.\n\nIn my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain.  Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. \n\nI present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true.  However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culture/rationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4). \n\nIn conclusion, this is but one of many examples where hyper-rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct. \n\n_____\n1. http://green.blogs.nytimes.com//2009/08/07/having-children-brings-high-carbon-impact/\n2. http://money.cnn.com/interactive/pf/cost-of-children/\n3. reddit.com/r/aww\n4. http://www.earth-policy.org/data_highlights/2011/highlights13\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Hooray poverty is solved!\n\nBut wait... What's to stop landlords (let's picture them as Mr. Burns) from calculating exactly how much extra everyone can pay now? Wouldn't the new *cheapest* place to rent be the maximum that a $15/hr wage could afford? I think people saying there would be less jobs is just fear mongering, but I would argue people making minimum wage would be no better off than they were before due to inflated costs of living if there are no limitations on those who set prices. And how fucked would you be if your current standard of living is based on making $16/hr, and suddenly rent prices raised like this? (You'd go from double the minimum wage to basically at the minimum wage).\n\nIf instead, we set regulations on necessary commodities (stuff you require to live like shelter) as a percentage of the wage of a minimum wage worker, wouldn't that make more sense? Free market works great for things people want, but not so well for things people need. For example, if the price of an Xbox exceeds what I think it's worth, I can simply live without one, demand will go down if they're priced too high, eventually the price will stabilize. But what am I willing to pay for a roof over my head? Heat in my apartment? Food on my table? Even if the price far exceeds what they cost to produce, I can't just decide to not pay for these things, so without limitations on what can be charged, what's to stop prices from going up indefinitely? (Looking at the US healthcare system, the answer seems to be nothing)\n\nLast, but not least, does raising the minimum wage perhaps discourage skilled labor? If you're a person who's worked hard or went into student loan debt in order to attain a $15/hr job, isn't this the rawest deal possible for you? Suddenly everyone is making the same as you, minus your debt payments, having done none of the hard work you did? Suddenly you went from middle class to the worst off of anyone, all because you worked hard/got skills in order to get a better job. (I don't have a $15/hr job, but I know a lot of people who are in this situation)\n\nSo, what am I missing here? Would greatly value input of anyone with education/experience in economics, since honestly, the reason I'm asking this question is because I have very little knowledge in the area. \n\n*TL;DR: I think raising the minimum wage would simply result in the cost of living raising to match, leaving minimum wage workers no better off and middle class folks worse off*\n\nChange my view/Educate me!"}

Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherent/natural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.)\n\nThere still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.\n\nIf \"Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world, just as physical law derives from the nature of space, time, and matter.\" my question is, how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature?\n\n\"It just does\" is not a sufficient answer.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights\n\nExplain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.\n\nI actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a \"gun-grabber\" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.) I'd rather get people educated and out of poverty. Etc. I tell you this so you can understand, I'm an open mind on this issue, and if you can't convince me, you probably won't convince anyone.\n\nTo be clear: I could give a **** about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all.\n\nAt the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter.\n\nI am currently against both \"gun grabbers\" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject. I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate.\n\nTell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights. Show the logical derivation from nature, which I believe you are claiming exists. currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights, It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality, justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe, harmonious, and productive society, and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end.\n\nif you can't convince me of this, (or at least correctly formulate _any_ argument defending your position) , you are probably not really going to convince anyone.\n\nBut If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment. Since guns take more lives than they save?\n\nTo claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God.\n\nI see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms. (Bonus: I can't imagine that there is any which wouldn't also \"justify\" the \"rights of monkeys to bear arms\".)\n\nI invite you to Change My View."}

Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.\n\n2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed.

He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered.

While both persons paid the same amount, after 20 years person A could sell his property and have $240,000 returned.\n\nI understand the importance of rent. Not every person has the financial backing to obtain a long term mortgage. However, there's something that seems wrong with the above. People of means can buy property and essentially have others (renters) pay the mortgage for them. \n\nWhile not a perfect solution, there's something that seems interesting that paying rent includes the requirement that .4% of the property ownership also transfers per month. Of course, the rent would be based in large part on the perceived value of the property and then also include costs that cover services. \n\nIf a person had a 2 year lease, they'd own almost 10% of the property. During lease renewal, maybe the owner will want to buy that 10% back or the person moves and sells it to a higher bidder. It might not stop slum lords from forcing tenants to sell back their .4% ever month or other under the table dealings, though laws can be set up to protect against such practices.\n\nOf course, property owners are not required to rent their property.

Except for the honorable dissent of Rand Paul, they oppose extending voting right to those convicted of crimes. \n\nThey are the party of the prison industrial complex.\n\nThey are the party of the police power structure, consistently supporting officers who kill unarmed black men and dismissing the BLM movement at every turn.\n\nThey oppose any kind of gun control, which we need to slow our ridiculous level of gun deaths.\n\n**Economy**\n\nThis section does not need any explanation.

I like romeo and juliet clauses but in general I think this way of thinking and justification is spot-on.\n\nI think it's 110% absurd though to apply this in situations where the minor meets their statutory rapist in an adult-restricted zone (in this case a zone designated for anybody above the relevant age of consent). This means 18+ clubs, 21+ bars, even 16+ shows where it takes place in a region where the age of consent is 16+.\n\n*This isn't a moral argument, it's a legal one*. I think it's so bizarre to expect adults in these areas to \"be on guard\". If anybody should be charged, it should be the venue that let them in due to negligence. I don't even know what to think about fraudulent IDs.\n\nI understand this isn't a super common occurrence, that typically it's parents who file charges and that minors aren't usually acting as weird predators. It's not about frequency, just that it exists.\n\nI'm not sure how easy it will be to change my view. I do know that I completely don't understand any arguments for this line of thought. I might just be confused. It just doesn't make sense to me. Maybe something will click.\n\nEDIT: I'm not sure how to make an edit to the title, but I'd rather have it be genderless. Sorry about that.\nEDIT2: My view has been changed multiple times over! I'm gonna stop with the deltas. Thank you everyone who helped! :)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If one or more all-white towns were formed, some of the racists throughout the country would move to these PLEs.

Raising the minimum wage would increase my payroll by 20% and I'm not thrilled with that idea. Why not?\n\nBecause the people I hire are often inexperienced, uneducated and/or have some restrictions on working (kids in school, they can only work these hours or those hours, limited mental capacity, etc). Hiring these people is okay with me because the jobs like cleaning cages and walking dogs and mucking stalls are very simple and require very minimal training. Some of my employees don't make much but they aren't asked to do very much and their hours are often very flexible. Work with animals in this way can be very forgiving and is often very rewarding. I find most people in my employ seem to like the work.\n\nIf I have to pay $15/hour, well, I can probably get better (more qualified, more experienced, better trained) people for that much. If my bare minimum is $15/hour, then suddenly it makes sense to ignore the high school dropouts and part timers and inexperienced folks. For this new minimum wage I can get experienced assistants and certified techs. Why should I pay so much to others? This doesn't help people who have a hard time getting a job, it hurts them. I'll pass them over for somebody who can do the job for real. For at least $75K (rough estimate) a year in additional costs, I can do better than what I've got.\n\nWhy wouldn't people like me just start ignoring the folks who made the old minimum wage and instead go for more qualified people who want the job at this higher minimum wage? \n\nAnd before anybody tells me what a bad person I am for making money and not caring that people make less than I do, please remember I went to school for a decade and incurred a mountain of debt and I bear all responsibility for what happens in my hospital. I put in the most work, I bear the greatest burden, take on the most risk, am financially responsible for a dozen other people, and for all that I get to make the most money.

{"title": "CMV:I believe US should spend more money on military.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3iulkj", "selftext": "1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk of its budget on military, millions of jobs will be lost.\n\n2. US has the money. Yes, US is in some serious debt right now, however USD is the most indestructible currency ever existed in human history, with US's economy size, gold reserve and military power at its back, it is impossible for USD to collapse in the foreseeable future. US can always borrow more money from its own citizen or foreign countries without worrying about crisis like Greece happen. Further more, even if USD value drops as a consequence of US printing more cash to pay back debts, all other countries will follow to de-value their currencies to compete with US, just like we have seen in the past few years.\n\n3. US spending more on military doesn't necessary mean a safer world, but at least it will make its NATO allies safer. As a Canadian I know we don't have to worry about fighting off an invasion alone. US spending more on defence means we will spend less, this will benefit our economy and allow us to put more money into our welfare system.\n \n4. No matter how much US government sets its 'defence' budget,  US's armed force is built to be an offence force. Considering how the military complex works and US politician/public thinks, US will never stop bombing/invading smaller countries to defend its 'freedom'. Spending more money developing and ensuring US's technological advantage on military means less casualties from those inevitable wars.\n\n5. Military technologies benefits civilian life in the long run. We wouldn't get internet, GPS, jumble jets and spacecraft if US haven't thrown so much money into military. I want to see human land on Mars before I am 50, so come on US congress, make it happen!\n\nEdit:\n\nTo answer some of the most frequent questions:\n\n**Why not spend the money on infrastructure/medical research/education/NASA?**\n\nWell, when US was cutting military spending in the 90s, the federal spending on education/infrastructure/NASA/higher education research also went down. I fundamentally disagree the argument that 'we are not spending enough on such/such/such because we spend too much on military!' The fact is the amount we spend on military and other programs is not a zero sum game. Spending less on military dose not bring US better infrastructure/education/research. \n\n**US is already spending too much on military, it's by far the most powerful force in the world, why more?**\n\nIn % per GDP sense, US ranked No.21 in the world(3.5%), behind Saudi Arabia (10.8%), Israel (5.2%) and Russia (4.5%), this is not that much. Comparing to those countries and the collapsed USSR, US is in a much better financial state (see my point 2).\n\nAlso, US government and public have set their military force to be the keeper of freedom/world police ever since the end of WWII. Yes the current size of US military is too big for a defensive force. However, for what US public and government want it to be? I think the current spending is well justified if not insufficient. "}

People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.\n\nI think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.\n\nAgain, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. \"Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!\" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. \"The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!\" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.\n\nThe US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are \"more focused on kids\". Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? \n\nIt's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place!\n\nIf paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the \"expected value\" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices. Kids pricing allows family's to be able to afford to go to things as a family. For certain things, size does matter (fuel costs for transportation) and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more. And specific to theaters, adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R-ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets, I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly \"niche\" category of movies. \n\nI think the problem I have is that most (if not all movie theaters) consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen. This doesn't make any sense. A thirteen year old doesn't have much more money does a twelve year old. They don't even have the right to work for another few years. They're not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn't really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer. They can't see rated R movies. It seems like the only \"right\" they've acquired is to technically see a PG-13 movie but they probably could do that before age thirteen and it hardly seems to justify a price increase. I know that thirteen is not universal but I find it wrong to charge adult prices for anyone under eighteen (you could maybe argue seventeen since they can see rated R movies and can work).\n\nPlease leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post.

While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe, fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US. I've even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews, even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date.\n\nThere is a widely-held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti-Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro-Israel. UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel. Still, extremist groups like the JDL (Jewish Defence League) attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations, despite their classification as a terrorist group.\n\nThe Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well. I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right-wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest. Currently, every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel; even left-wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada's frontrunner Tom Mulcair.\n\nMeanwhile, white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution. When the Charleston shooting broke out, my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser. My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah, Passover, Purim, Yom Ha'Shoah, etc. I realize this may come off as anti-Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a \"self-hating Jew\", although I think this only reinforces my point.

Women seem to look for areas in which they could possibly be seen as oppressed, even though it's likely that they are not being intentionally oppressed. For example, if a man suggests that a certain job would be done better by a man (which is IMO entirely possible for some positions) that would be seen as sexist an/or oppressive towards women.

There's even [scientific research from Oberlin University and Trinity University (San Antonio)](http://mentalfloss.com/article/64984/science-behind-why-people-hate-word-moist) on why we hate the word so much. It's pretty well-documented: we don't like the word.\n\nHowever, I'd like to propose that \"moist\" is definitely not the worst word in the English language. There are plenty of words that are \"worse,\" but I'd like to focus on \"bulbous\" for the purpose of this CMV.\n\nThink about it in terms of the ratio of possible positive uses of the word vs possible negative uses. \"Moist\" has a lot of positive connotations. You might describe a delicious chocolate cake as \"moist,\" for example. You might also use moisturizer if your hands are feeling dry. (I mean, we're still selling things with that name! You'd think we'd switch from \"moisturizer\" if it were truly despicable.)\n\nCompare this with \"bulbous.\" I cannot think of a single positive connotation associated with the word. It's a word you'd use to describe something like a wart on a foot or a disgusting growth on a six-month-old container of yogurt. Using this metric, \"bulbous\" is a far grosser word.\n\nThe other argument I'll make here is that the mouth shape you make to say \"bulbous\" is way worse than that of \"moist.\" You have to twist it all sorts of disheartening ways - closed to open to squished close again to open again to a gross final-s sound. Comparatively, \"moist\" is a walk in the park - one quick flare of the mouth and you're done.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: People who want their partner to be monogamous do not deserve relationships", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ipyh0", "selftext": "I'm not saying *monogamous* people do not deserve relationships, to the extent that they simply don't want other partners. If a person doesn't want another partner, that's okay. Most of the time, I also don't wish for any other partners than my wife.\n\nWhat I'm saying, however, is that people do not deserve relationships to the extent that they want to impose monogamous *restrictions* on their partner.\n\nAs a society, we do not recognize agreements that attempt to take away a person's individuality. If you enter an agreement where you willingly become a slave, we do not recognize this. If you enter an agreement where you become an indentured servant, we do not recognize this.\n\nSimilarly, when you say your marriage vows, and make an implicit promise that your genitals will only ever touch your partner's, this is giving away individuality. Legally, this promise is not enforceable. We do not recognize it.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that we need to go beyond just a legal position, and recognize that *morally*, also, these promises should not have our respect. It is not moral to relinquish individuality.\n\nIf two people do not want other partners, that is great. They *should* be able to have a relationship that does not involve anyone else. But there should be **no expectation**, from either partner, that this state of affairs will continue indefinitely. The two partners should enjoy such a relationship as long as it lasts, and not attach strings.\n\nAt no point should a person expect from their partner to *never* want to be intimate with anyone else, and at no point should a person make their partner promise such a thing. Such an expectation is immoral; immature; insecure; possessive; jealous; and selfish. Such a promise keeps these non-respectable qualities even if, at one point in time, the promise and the desire to make it are mutual.\n\n-----\n\nResponses to common retorts:\n\n-----\n\n**0. You're ignoring that monogamy works fine for so many people!**\n\nI'm not ignoring that. If monogamy works for you, do it. However, I *am* saying that the proper way to do that is by being monogamous *yourself*; not by holding someone else &amp;#8211; your partner &amp;#8211; to a strict monogamous expectation.\n\nIf monogamy truly works, long-term, both for you and for your partner, you will walk into it by happenstance. If that happens to you, nothing is wrong with it. Just don't try to make that happen with coercion.\n\n**1. Society is based on contracts; employment agreements also encroach on individuality**\n\n&gt; When you sign up for a job, you agree be at a certain place, awake and sober, and perform tasks for hours on end regularly in return for money.\n\nAs an employer, I take steps to maximize my employees' individuality. My agreement with them is that they're paid for actual work they do (they are software developers), and I pay them handsomely for the work that is done well.\n\nI make no requirements encroaching on them that are not absolutely necessary. Everyone works from home, and can have an environment they like. I do not require certain hours to be kept. I make no impositions on their drug use or sobriety. I make no imposition that they cannot quit their jobs at any time, and go work for a competitive company.\n\nThis is because I believe work should be truly voluntary. I think the companies that practice these encroachments are in fact being immoral, and are exploiting negotiating leverage. I do not wish to be that type of employer.\n\nI believe a large portion of our world, of our economies, is based on subtle slavery. I believe we should be acting to change this, and the first place to start is with intimate relationships that ought to be loving.\n\n&gt; Society doesn't work if everyone goes around doing whatever they want all the time, \n\nTo a large extent, we are *vastly* exaggerating the encroachments on individuality that we believe are necessary, and should be reducing these encroachments in all areas, both intimate and in employment.\n\n-----\n\n**2. I also expect my partner to be financially responsible, to travel with me, to not do drugs.**\n\nExpecting your partner to generally be financially responsible is one thing. But blowing up when they've purchased this *one* item that seems unnecessary to you is another.\n\nWanting your partner to share your interests is one thing. But blowing up when they don't want to travel with you to this *one* particular country is another.\n\nExpecting your partner to not smoke pot all day, and your home to not be full of smoke, is one thing. But blowing up when they've had a joint with a friend this one time is another.\n\nSimilarly: expecting your partner to mostly be available to meet your needs is one thing. But blowing a gasket because this one time they flirted / kissed / had safe sex with someone is another.\n\n-----\n\n**3. Expecting a person to not be intimate with others; and expecting a person to tolerate such intimacy; are the same type of coercion.**\n\nOnly to the extent that a cartoonist drawing Mohammad, and a fanatic calling for beheading in response, are the same type of insult. The drawing is not even an insult, unless you *choose* to interpret it that way.\n\nThe pain of a Muslim who saw a drawing of Mohammad is self-inflicted, and rooted in unhealthy beliefs. The pain of a person whose partner was intimate with someone is similarly self-inflicted, and rooted in unhealthy beliefs.\n\nWhen a person physically stabs you, it's their fault. But when it feels like you're being stabbed because your partner wants to express their love or lust with someone else, you're not being hurt by *them*. You're being hurt by jealousy and insecurities that you have not overcome, but can.\n\nThis is *your pain*, which you don't need to feel; and would not feel, if a sick culture wasn't telling you that you need to. Just like the pain of the Muslim seeing a drawing of Mohammad is a pain he doesn't need to feel; and would not feel, if his own sick culture wasn't telling him he needs to.\n\nYou may think this comparison is unfair and hurtful because Muslims who call for beheadings are obviously crazy, *as opposed to you*. But do you think those Muslims believe themselves crazy? They think they're *justified* &amp;#8211; as do you."}

Some see it as just a casual thing, others a sacred act. But in the end, I doubt anyone would dispute the claim that a desire for sex is one of the most natural things about being human, secondary only to wanting food/water/shelter, and on equal standing to a desire for life fulfillment and companionship.\n\nSo why then, is having sex with a lot of people viewed as bad? Especially when you're taking the proper measures to make sure both you and your partner are safe, and you are not going to produce an unwanted baby....\n\nWomen in particular are the ones who get this sorta flack the most. It's very easy yet also extremely nasty to call a fellow girl a whore/slut/tramp etc when you want to discredit her. It's implied that a woman is somehow dirty or is a low life or what have you simply because she chooses to have a lot of sex.\n\nBut what happens when a guy has a lot of sex? He get's applauded for it. It's seen as him \"just doing what guys do.\" It's almost like it is encouraged. Even gay guys like myself don't get flack for having a lot of casual sex (we get shit for a totally different reason lmfao) but generally our straight allies don't tend to question our behavior all that much. At least, from my experience..\n\nSo why is it bad for a girl to have a lot of sex? I get that girls sexual \"wiring\" is different from guys as they generally leads to them having different/lower sex drives. But when a girl DOES have a high sex drive, and doesn't want a relationship, WHY IS THAT BAD?\n\nFootnote: Any girls out there reading this who like having lots of sex GOOD FOR YOU MAN.

The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of \"developed/first-world.\" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most Europeans/Americans would respond to this by saying \"I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?\" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goods/money down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legal/practical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. \n\nThe need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do \"bad things\", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.\n\n\nEDIT: Keep the comments coming guys - \"i'll secede on that point - \"moral guidance\" is not evidence for human weakness.

I pitied him, as he (seemed) to genuinely believe that he was an actual starship, and assuming no drugs were involved, I expect most of society also does.\n\n* A young man who frequents a card shop I visit believes himself to be a wolverine.  Not the marvel superhero, an actual badger-like creature indigenous to the Adirondacks of upstate New York.  Most people treat him rather poorly, as he acts like a wild animal fairly often, but I also pity him as he truly believes he is a wolverine.\n\n* A previously homosexual, previously male friend of mine recently came out as \"trans\" meaning that he(now she) would like to live life as a woman.  Society seems to say that this should be celebrated, that this is a brave and good act.\n\nI view all these 3 stories as on the same spectrum and should be treated the same.  Either we treat all three as varying levels of delusion/mental illness, or we work as hard as we can to make those people feel right in society.  All three people think they are something that they are not, so I feel that societies responses should be consistent either:\n\n1. Treat all 3 cases as mental illness.  Realize that mental illnesses exist, and if there is no cure, it is something that must be managed, just as with bi-polar, multiple personality disorder, etc.\n\n2. Celebrate this, and have the person live their lives in their own manner.  My male (now female) friend can live and be treated like any woman, that young man (now animal) at the card shop can live and be treated like a wolverine, and that older man (now starship) can be free to pursue a career at NASA as a test shuttle or whatever. (It's an extreme example, so the metaphor doesn't quite hold up)\n\nNow I have no problem with any of the three people.  None are hurting anyone, and unless they are disrespectful I have no qualms about interacting with any of them.

The current reason as I see it is that they fit better into their reassigned gender roles, which I respect, but gender roles would be eliminated by many feminists, given a chance.\n\nBeacause of this, I see transgenderism as either meaningless in the context of Feminism, or a stepping stone for a pseudo-Orwellian future of counter-constructive normality.  \n\nPlease CMV.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

After such unprofessional behavior became public and a national news item, Ramos should've been fired immediately.\n\nI'm not a fan of Trump, I would not vote for him, and I don't think he'll get the nomination.  However, whether you hate him or not, trolling a presidential candidate during a press conference is an embarrassment to the nation, makes a mockery of out our democratic process, and coming from a journalist, should lead to a dismissal.\n\nIf we instead agree that trolling presidential candidates is OK if they had it coming, then it opens the floodgates to anyone who dislikes a candidate to disrupt our democratic process.

{"title": "CMV: Negative stereotyping and profiling can only change when the potential victims break the stereotype.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ijgiq", "selftext": "This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view, hence this post. I'm a little embarrassed to share it. Here's my basic line of thought:\n\n* Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.\n* Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves.\n* A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else.\n* If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur.\n* When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. \n\n'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout \"victim blaming!\" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are *very rarely* 100% free from some kind of responsibility. \n\nAn example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with/ resisting the police officer. We *might* be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. \n\nAnother quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying \"not all men are pigs.\" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. \n\nObviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor(s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. \n\nI'm happy to edit for any needed clarification. \nCMV!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The United States is broken beyond repair, and it is only a matter of time before a total collapse of the nation", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ijaz9", "selftext": "I don't want to live in the USA anymore. I never really did. Only thing here for me is friends and what tiny family I have. If I had the resources and the guts to leave everything behind, I would leave at the first chance I am given. Here's a list of reasons why I believe the United States is unfixable, and the only thing left to do is jump ship:\n\n* **Education** is based on test scores and Scantron test bubbles, not how well any given student is learning. Privatized education is stealing from public education funding, resulting in crumbling public schools and a wealthy elite private school system.\n\n* **There is no living wage**, minimum wage is a joke ($7.25/hr) and some places even get away with customers paying for a worker's wages (tipping at restaurants, hotel valets, etc). [Corporate profits are at an all time high](http://ycharts.com/indicators/corporate_profits) while [worker's wages are stagnant](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/wages) and barely increasing, if not decreasing.\n\n* **Student Loans** are out of control, absurdly inflated while students are having a harder and harder time finding work. Textbooks are overpriced and updated minimally for easy revenue when the latest version is required with little content improvement.\n\n* **Media** reports on nonsense until a tragedy, violence or a corporate agenda is at hand.\n\n* **Police Force** is over-militarized and over-protected. Police unions make sure officers are treated with impunity, even with sufficient evidence and contradictory eyewitness reports. Police brutality is not going away.\n\n* **Drug War** is a war on the people. Addiction and abuse is punished criminally instead of treated as a mental illness/condition. Tax money is lost on illegal drugs traded by armed criminals, promoting cartels and black markets.\n\n* **Prisons** are over crowded with non-violent offenders and poor Americans who couldn't pay ridiculous fines or fees. For-profit and private prison systems are an atrocity, some even enslave prisoners for manual labor. Guantanamo Bay is a violation of human rights.\n\n* **Politics** are corrupted and solely motivated by money. Lobbying is out of control. Campaign donations are essentially legal bribes, and corporations and mega-companies have to much political influence.\n\n* **Military** has an immense budget while producing useless, unneeded weaponry and equipment. United States fights unnecessary wars and infiltrates and overthrows peaceful governments.\n\n* **Gun Control** needs reform. Mental evaluation and criminal background checks need to be performed thoroughly before any firearm can be purchased or acquired.\n\n* **NSA spying** and the surveillance state need to be dismantled. Huge swaths of data is being collected, stored waiting to be misused. Spying on its own citizens and allies violates human rights. The TSA needs reform, right now it's a useless taxpayer void, where useless machines and invasive procedures are becoming more and more prevalent.\n\n* **Copyrights and patents** are creating turmoil for startups and new ideas. Large companies consistently and deliberately misuse and even change copyright laws to benefit themselves, while stifling innovation and hurting people's rights to free information.\n\n* **Net Neutrality, free trade and personal privacy** is daily being eroded and constantly in danger: SOPA, CISPA, Trans Pacific Partnership, PATRIOT Act, PIPA, [Special 301 Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_301_Report))\n\n* **Social Security** has been abused and taken advantage of by the Baby Boomer generation. The retirement age is ever increasing beyond what should be considered normal due to technology and computers, taking up jobs from younger people looking for work. Saving for retirement is becoming increasingly difficult.\n\n* **Wall Street and the Big Banks** steal/lose/launder trillions while facing little to no punishment, in the way of fines or breaking up the companies. Instead, these banks are bailed out by the government using government loans, causing inflation, devaluing the dollar, and increasing the national debt. Don't get started on predatory interest rates and payday loan schemes.\n\nThe list could probably be longer, but I've run out of will power to describe my nation's flaws. They depress me and remind me every day that it's harder and harder to leave as soon as I can. If you need sources on any of the points I've provided, feel free to Google them unless I've already provided the link. I'm willing to change my view. But just look at all this mess. I feel so helpless being a lower-middle class, average joe kind of guy with the facade of the American dream vanishing further and further every day. I don't want to live like this forever. I want to be happy and support a nation that isn't corrupt and cares about it's citizens. So Reddit, can you change my view?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I disagree with the philosophy of not giving any attention to gunmen", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3iimrq", "selftext": "I'm not entirely sure if I agree with the \"no attention to the gunmen\" philosophy after tragic shootings. I think we can all agree that a major part of the problem is mental illness, and as hard as it may be to forgive someone for an atrocious crime like this, we have to understand that the shooter's reality is far far different from a normal reality. As strong as the urge is to call the shooter a piece of shit, I believe this behavior will only further alienate mentally ill and perpetuate the \"us vs them\" mentality they have. Contrarily, if we looked past the (albeit powerful) urge to dismiss the shooter as inhumane and instead welcome them to forgiveness and treatment, it may be an important step in bridging the disconnect between the mentally ill and mentally healthy; it may also prompt the mentally ill to seek help early before the illness becomes uncontrollable.\n\nEdit: Many of the replies focus on the media glorification of shooters, turning them into \"celebrities\". I should have been more clear that I do NOT believe this is productive. Rather, I believe that completely ignoring the shooter from media is also unproductive in that the media (instead of focusing on the bizarre ideologies of the shooters) should instead focus on the mental illness aspects, warning signs, and appropriate means of intervention. Only in this way can the root cause, mental illness, be addressed and not just ignored. This would then shift the \"celeb-dom\" paradigm to a mental illness paradigm, which I think is important for both the general public and the confused people who are considering committing such acts. \n\nEdit 2: By warning signs and intervention, I clearly don't mean in the face of an ongoing shooting. I mean beforehand. Regarding this most recent case of the journalist and cameraman, I read that the news staff unanimously noticed odd and hostile behavior from the now-shooter and their response was to fire him. While firing him entirely justifiable since his behavior was interfering with his ability to perform his job, perhaps this odd and hostile behavior deserved some recognition, discussion, and possible intervention? I wouldn't know specifically what, since I'm not a practicing psychologist/psychiatrist, but if his behavior was peculiar enough to warrant removing him from his job perhaps an expert would agree that this is a sign that intervention, or some type of discussion, is appropriate. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Polygamy should be legal in the Western world (United States, Canada, Europe and Oceania)", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ii3wn", "selftext": "I see nothing wrong with polygamy. The only problem I could see occurring in polygamous marriages is the destruction of traditional marriage, however this has been argued to have been a problem with same-sex marriage. Like same-sex marriage, I can see no ethical dilemmas brought upon by introducing polygamous marriages besides the religious. Our nation is not built upon religious foundations, we are a secular state, therefore using Christian morals to argue what is marriage what is not is not a viable reason to keep polygamy illegal. Prior to European colonization (headed by Christian leaders), many cultures from around the world practiced polygamous marriages for thousands of years. Now after decolonization, this has been shrunk to mostly the Middle East, Indonesia, West Asia, Myanmar and most of Africa.\n\nThere have been some that have argued in the past that polygamous marriages have a higher rate of abuse of women. However, if we look at who is practicing polygamy and where it is currently legal, can we truly say that the type of marriage is at fault? Most (if not all) nations where polygamy is legal are Islamic nations. The religion in and of itself is not known for being respectful towards women nor tolerant of them deviating from the wishes of their husband (or government). Can we truly say that abuse would become less prevalent in Muslim countries if all marriages were suddenly turned to monogamous ones? Others will point to certain cults that have split off from the main Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and speak of their abuse against women and even rampant pedophilia. This is once again a bad example. Who in the United States is practicing polygamy? More often than not; cults. Cults are often cults of personality, the worship of a single person; the cult leader. Can we expect a person who has made themselves out to be something of a prophet (or more) to respect their spouses or basic human rights? Probably not. Let's think for a moment and say that a nation like India happened to be the first to legally same-sex marriage. If there was a high amount of abuse among marriages, surely this would be seen in gay and lesbian ones as well. Could we then not point to India and exclaim that same-sex marriage simply does not work?\n\nSome argue that there are simply too few people interested in a polygamous lifestyle for people to protest its ban or for legislation to be passed to overturn it. This is true, however it does not change the absurdity of being against it. Many things are legal (or are simply not illegal) that few people practice. Does that mean that they should be illegal because they deviate from the norm?\n\nThis is does not exclude the possibility of non-abuse marriages by non-Islamic, non-cultist polygamous marriages. There has been the concept of non religious marriages involving multiple partners for men and women since the hippy era of the United States.\n\nWe are a free society, a free nation. Why should we decide how many a man or woman chooses to marry? Who are we to deny these marriages? Are we so morally superior that we can dictate that marriage must be between two individuals? I do not see the appeal of polygamous marriage, however I do not see myself as one to judge."}

No matter what your conscious reasoning, you cannot escape the fact that the reason you care about looking good *at all* is because you were raised in a culture where it is practically screamed in your face every day that \"A GOOD WOMAN IS BEAUTIFUL! A GOOD WOMAN IS ATTRACTIVE!\"\n\nTherefore, when a woman claims that she dresses/makes up so that she can feel good about herself (as opposed to doing it to please/attract men), it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what you claim because the end result is the same: you ARE pleasing and attracting men, and you are valuing yourself based on attractiveness. It doesn't even matter if you're not straight. You are doing what the patriarchal system has dictated to you that you must do, and in so doing you are reinforcing that system. After all, isn't it a mighty big coincidence that the thing you 'want' to do just happens to line up perfectly with what the system wants you to do?\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am not judging women who dress/make up. I do not care what you do, but I think this is an important distinction that must addressed, because the closest you can get to choosing for yourself is acknowledging the motivation for the choice (the part you can't control) and accepting it for what it is.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The United States is unfairly judged for wanting to stop illegal immigration, when the rest of the world is doing the same thing.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ih775", "selftext": "If you've been following the political hoo-ha surrounding the upcoming presidential election then you are well aware of the controversial topic of illegal immigration. The discussion is pretty clear. The right believes in doing what they can to end it. The left feels that we need to give access to a better life even if it that access isn't attained legally.\n\nRegardless of which you believe, the reality is that every other successful nation is going through a similar thing. If you look at the growing problems with migrants in Greece &amp; Macedonia. If you look at the refuge issues in places in the Middle East like Jordan and Lebannon. You will see that people are fleeing their homelands for the hopes of a better life.\n\nHowever these hopes come with the destruction of hopes for those who are already in that better land. There are limited resources and giving access to those resources to people who want to come to your country, means that they will not be available for you. This problem is huge and countries are taking varying measures.\n\nPlaces like Macedonia are blockading their border. Places like Hungary are building fences. Places like Jordan are setting up refuge camps not allowing for access outside of them. \n\nHowever when the U.S. suggests that they too need to be taking measures to protect their resources, they are left to handle stark criticism. Criticism that ranges from \"racists\" to \"fascists\". However this same criticism seems to be absent for much of the other countries in the world who believe in protecting their resources and their borders.\n\nI believe the criticism is lacking in Europe because people understand that these migrants are having a detrimental affect on the societies. If you look at the problem expanded immigration has caused in France, Germany, Greece, England and many other nations, you begin to sympathize with taking measures to stop it.\n\nFor some reason this reality seems to be ignored when it comes to people over running U.S. borders. It seems as if people think the U.S. has unlimited resources and that any and all should have access to them. \n\nThe narrative is often to say that these people just want to make a better life for themselves. Yes, as does every other person in this world. But in order for them to make a better life they need resources to do so. Those resources are being kept from people who should have access to them (legal immigrants and citizens).\n\nI see no reason why the U.S. should be criticized for wanting to protect the resources and keeping them for U.S. citizens and legal residents. \n\nEurope's problems should be a lesson that we learn from and try to avoid happening to us. This isn't just a problem that is social, political, financial it is all of that and more. Many experts believe the migrant problem will be the single greatest cause of the collapse of the E.U..  Reason being, there is no plan in place to stop this influx and no European commission to oversee this problem. Countries are left to fend for themselves and they will look out for \"themselves\".\n\nThe U.S. should be wise enough to do something about this now or be left to deal with the same faith. \n\nI don't see why trying to avoid that faith is deserving of criticism.

{"title": "CMV: It's dishonest when feminists respond to criticism of feminism with \"It's just the belief that women are equal\"", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ih0n2", "selftext": "I'll preface this with saying that I'm a guy and I consider myself extremely feminist and would disagree with the criticisms for feminism for other reasons. I think it's clear that modern feminism is much more than just that belief, and that it's totally reasonable to believe that women and men should be equal, but not be feminist.\n\n**There are multiple valid perceptions of equality, some of which do not lend themselves to modern feminism**\n\nThe perception of equality that most critics of feminism would subscribe to would be a pretty basic \"equality of opportunity,\" where women are given the same legal rights as men. For the most part, this sense of equality is achieved in the developed world, and feminism doesn't seem extremely necessary\n\nThe more feminist perception of equality is a more complex view of equality of opportunity that attempts to achieve equality through other actions. For example, many biases prevent women from succeeding in certain fields, so feminists would often embrace some form of affirmative action or grants for women in these fields. I personally believe this is the right way to go about things, but it's it would technically violate the very strict interpretation of equality. Other policies like supporting abortion, maternity leave, etc. all attempt to create equality by making physical factors that advantage men over women less of an issue would fit the same argument as above.\n\n**3rd wave feminism is more than just wanting equality**\n\nFeminism has evolved from just \"women deserve equal rights\" to a discussion about what it means to be female (or other gender and sometimes racial identities.) This type of discussion is really interesting and really important. However, it can be off-putting to somebody who doesn't really fit the identities feminism focuses on (mainly cisgendered men.) \n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable for a guy who isn't interested in discussing female identity in modern society to not identity as feminist, or even feel abandoned by it. There are plenty of ways that feminism helps men, but those issues tend to be on the back-burner. Unfortunately, there's not many misogyny-free communities for discussing men's issues. Until more of those exist and are promoted, it doesn't make much sense to expect men to identify as feminist.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: I don't think Jesus was an actual, historical person.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ifrs6", "selftext": "Right now there is almost an unanimous consensus among scholars that Jesus was a real human being. They even go as far as comparing the Christ myth theory to the Moon Landing conspiracy theories and Holocaust deniers. I think their confidence is unwarranted and here's why:\n\n*We have ZERO evidence of any Christian activity whatsoever before Paul wrote Galatians around 40-60AD, and no conclusively Christian artifacts have been found dating any earlier than 70 AD. Supposedly Jesus was already attracting huge crowds during his lifetime, and Israel has been studied extensively by archaeologists for a long time. You would think we would find some sort of trinket or writing contemporary to his life, but we've found nothing. Israel was already very literate during Christ's time. Despite what people popularly say, we do have much more evidence for Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great than we do for Christ. That's to be expected of course, but considering how popular the Gospels portray Jesus as being and how much of Israel has been dug up, you'd think we'd have SOMETHING from his lifetime attesting to his existence.\n\n*The attestations by Josephus, Tacitus and Suetonius are very dubious. Scholars even admit that part of the Testimonium Flavianum was forged. \n\n*Paul seems to be writing about a heavenly Jesus, not an earthly one at times in his letters.\n\n*The Principle of Embarrassment is a very weak argument. We just don't know enough about the context of that era.\n\n*The Gospels are written in Greek. Jesus spoke Aramaic. It's possible he also spoke Greek, but you would think the Gospels would have been written in Aramaic originally if they were genuine accounts of Jesus's life.\n\n*The Gospels have huge issues. Aside from the fact that they describe magical happenings, they can't even get things like the year he was born right. One gospel suggests that Jesus was born around 5 BC, another suggests 6 AD. Since it's obvious the magical parts didn't happen, is it really that radical to come to the conclusion the whole story is a work of fiction?\n\nI think what happened is there was a preacher in Israel (who was maybe named Yeshua) at the time who claimed to be God and tried to overthrow the Roman client state with his followers and was executed for it. His followers, mostly poor illiterates, started telling tall tales about things he supposedly did while he was alive.\n\nEventually decades later, some literate Greek believers, most likely in Anatolia wrote made-up biographies of this preacher's life and tacked on moral sayings they attributed to him. Some of these stories became very popular to the extent that people were willing to die for their faith.\n\nIn other words, there may have been a person who Jesus was very loosely based on, but the Jesus that Christians worship is essentially a character from political fanfiction. Either that or entirely made up.\n\nCan anyone point me to some evidence that proves Jesus was in fact a real man, who was born under Herod, performed miracles in front of masses of crowds, and went fishing with his buddies in the freshwater Sea of Galilee, only to be killed for it?\n\nI'm not looking at this from a snarky anti-theist view, though I do happen to be an atheist. I just don't think the evidence is compelling or very convincing.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I'm from Detroit - where every single apartment I viewed had a fridge included. The first apartment I went to I was like - WHAT? NO FRIDGE????\n\n\n[In California, a refrigerator is not a habitable condition. It's an amenity.] (http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/08/business/la-fi-rent-20120108)\nI found out via r/personalfinance that in Texas  - an air conditioning unit is a habitable condition - meaning the landlord must provide and repair it. In fact, when your A/C unit breaks (and its not tenants' fault), you might not owe rent for days its broken because the unit is only livable while the A/C is working per Texas law.  \n\n\nThere are several reasons state law should change to make a fridge a habitable condition. \n\n*  *I believe every other state requires this as a habitable condition, correct me if I'm wrong.* In my personal opinion an apartment without a fridge in not habitable, wouldn't you agree? but more importantly.... \n\n* *There's a lot of illegal bait-and-switch going on in the apartment rental market.* I'm shopping for an apartment now and I would say about half the listings that say \"fridge included\" are just outright lies. I caught a landlord in this lie just yesterday. He said \"oh well I must have made a mistake online...\" This also happens with dishwashers and with rent prices. You're not fooling any damn body, you listed imaginary apartment with fake pictures, just to get people to show up so you can start throwing sales shit at them.  Sometimes, in areas where the market is really hot (such as West Hollywood), people sign for apartments without having seen the inside first (because the unit is already leased by the time previous tenants move out). Making a fridge an optional amenity gives landlords the ability to LIE and say the unit comes with a fridge and then when they move in, they find out that the fridge belonged to the previous tenants. \nYou might say \"well they should read the lease before they sign\" but that logic only holds up in theory. In reality you know there are people getting screwed over on this issue. Such as people from other states who it never occurred to them that a fridge might not be included. \n\n* *California law should mimc Texas law* When a habitable condition appliance breaks, the landlord is losing rent money every day it sits broken. In Michigan, when a unit is unlivable, a tenant can break a lease with no penalty and no notice. That gives them very strong incentive to hurry up and fix it already. \nIf Texas does this with air conditioners, why cant California do this with a damn refrigerator? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: There is nothing wrong with animal testing", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3idcl1", "selftext": "So let me start off by acknowledging that I know absolutely nothing about this issue, about its history, or about the debate surrounding it. My only exposure is seeing bottles that say \"not tested on animals\" and the hippy kids at school with stickers and posters saying \"stop animal testing\"\n\nLet me also say that I believe in compassion for animals, I don't support battery farms or puppy mills because I don't believe that its necessary to subject animals to that level of degradation simply for economic benefit, and i'm willing to pay more money as a consumer to express that belief. \n\nHowever I have no moral problems with eating meat or killing animals, as I don't see that as cruel, and people need to eat. I'm not a big fan of hunting simply for sport though.\n\nNow that I've given you a picture of my general stance on animal rights, let me say that It seems to me that animal testing could be a cruel and painful thing to subject an animal to (i'm imagining chemical burns and poisoning),  The only alternative I see is human testing. Either as part of the manufacturing process, or on the end consumer. And I think this is worse since human health and safety takes precedence over that of animals. (Edit: yes this last sentence is a personal opinion, not an objective fact) \n\nEven if people opt in and are paid to have mysterious substances tested on them, I'm quite sure it will be kids and mothers in the slums of bangladesh, or some other equally desperate section of the population who is taking extreme actions for money out of desperation, and to protect them I think that it is better to not give them such an option.\n\nThe only alternative I see that is better than animal testing would be if we had the technology to reliably predict all effects on humans in a lab without any interaction with an animal or human. However I have not been able to find anything suggesting this is true.\n\nSo either change my view on animal testing or prove to me that companies that don't test on animals test in a lab without involving humans or animals, and that their results are equally reliable to those based on animal testing.\n\n**EDIT: So a lot of people are taking the angle of \"Medical uses are fine, but cosmetic uses are just harm for our enternainment, why not just get rid of all makeup\" and I am totally fine with that argument, but that doesn't really change my view. If we decide that makeup isn't worth the harm to animals, I can get onboard that without an issue, but if makeup is going to exist, I still think that animal testing is the best option. There is plenty of cosmetics out there with \"no animal testing\" labels, which is what got me thinking about this in the first place.**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: If people fully understood games in the vein of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, they would be much more mainstream", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3icqty", "selftext": "D&amp;D, while it's managed to achieve pretty good cultural penetration (i.e. lots of people know what it is), tends to get a pretty bad rap. It's associated with basement-dwelling, BO-heavy obese teens and college students, particularly men. I'm actually not going to argue with that impression so much, because frankly I'm not convinced it isn't based in truth (actually, I think it once was, but isn't as much anymore). What I will argue is that this is irrelevant to what a game like D&amp;D actually is, and what it offers a group of people sitting around a table with beer and pizza. I believe that if everyone were actually exposed to it, beyond just the basic idea and the cultural stigma, it would be widely played (it already is *more* widely played than it was twenty years ago, but that's not the same). \n\nFor anyone who's never played it, or anything like it, here's the basic rundown: I tell you that you walk into the living room of a house. There's a table with a book on it, a door that's closed so you can't see what it leads to, and an open doorway through which you can see the next room, which is larger and fancier. You can choose to interact with any of these given things\u2014but more importantly, you can do *anything else*. You can jump out the window. You can search the couch cushions for change. You can set fire to the whole house. And I will be obligated to provide more material for you regardless of what you choose to do. The story proceeds in our collective mind's eye with literally limitless choice and narrative flexibility.\n\nThe only thing governing your actions, keeping this from being a game of straight-up make believe, is that there's a set of skills with accompanying numerical levels to determine whether you actually *can* do the thing you want. Are you perceptive enough to find those coins? Can you strike a match without burning yourself? You can peruse the book, but are you smart enough for it? Your number with that skill, along with a dice roll to add some randomness, tells you if you pull it off. There's an element of chance and risk. Since you can't do *everything* you want, what you do choose suddenly becomes much more meaningful. You have to know what you're good at, what your odds are, and what possible results your actions will have. It's basically a gigantic thought experiment, a hypothetical situation that you get to navigate. Ever become lucid at the end of a dream and wish you could stay? That's sort of what D&amp;D offers. Sort of. \n\nFor any given element of what the game requires, there's already a mainstream activity that revels in it. Do you like crunching statistics in the service of a non-real competition? Play fantasy football. Do you like to pretend to be a character? Play a murder mystery game\u2014or, you know, act in something. Do you like rolling dice? Play a very, very wide variety of the things. Do you like dragons and swords? Watch *Game of Thrones*. What sets D&amp;D apart from more socially acceptable pastimes isn't really in its actual execution, but in the demographic we associate with it, and our desire to *not be of that demographic*. \n\nBut here's the thing: you can play sports without being stupid, perform on stage without being a prima donna. Who you are doesn't depend on how you spend your free time. We all intuitively understand this with most activities, but the view of D&amp;D is so strong it makes us forget. If you take away the medieval dressing, and put yourself in the picture instead of the fat, pimply nerd, you get something not much different from, say, Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit. **D&amp;D is a fairly complex example, and I use it only because it's the most famous, but there are others that share the fundamentals while being much simpler and more casual.** (Edit: I've bolded this due to several responses related to time commitment, although I would again argue that the time you spend on fantasy football or binge-watching *Game of Thrones* is no less than what you'd spend on a game like this one.) Boiled down to its essentials, the game is just a shared storytelling.

I disagree, Hitler was a godawful leader, as good leaders tend not to leave their countries into such total destruction. And the claim that Hitler saved Germany from depression is false, the economic reforms that pulled Germany's bacon out of the economic fire were done by [Hjalmar Schacht.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjalmar_Schacht) Hitler's economic policies set Germany on the course to [financial ruin](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3i78h9/why_do_some_historians_say_nazi_germany_was/cudz604) and forced them into a situation where the only way to survive was to invade and plunder their neighbors. \n\n\nSo. Hitler ruined the previously successful economic situation, made military alliances with Italy and Japan that did nothing for him except get him in further trouble with an American enemy and an Italian ally constantly needing help, played hell with the warfront by sacking any general who crossed his opinion, and spent valuable resources creating internal strife by persecuting his own people.\n\n\n\nSo I say Hitler was a good speaker, but a terrible leader.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Obviously, any specific incident in which a heterosexual male is criticized may or may not be misogynistic based the context of the situation. So this post is mainly inspired by a recent event in the news when a fraternity was suspended for posting banners on their house. You can read about it [here](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Virginia-Fraternity-Suspended-Over-Freshman-Daughter-Drop-Off-Sign-322740331.html) or [here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/24/virginia-frat-suspended-old-dominion-university/32298193/) \n\nThe basic summary is that a fraternity posted signs with the following messages: \n\n&gt;Rowdy And Fun! Hope your baby girl is ready for a good time\n\n&gt;Freshman daughter drop off\n\n&gt;Go ahead and drop off mom too\n\nin response, the university president made the following statement equating the posters to condoning sexual assault:\n\n&gt;I am outraged about the offensive message directed toward women that was visible for a time on 43rd Street. Our students, campus community and alumni have been offended. While we constantly educate students, faculty and staff about sexual assault and sexual harassment, this incident confirms our collective efforts are still failing to register with some.\n\nIt is my view that the banners posted by the fraternity are merely expressing their desire to have sex with women, and never say anything about sexual assault. Equating the two is a fallacy, and is unfair to the men who made the posters. \n\nFurthermore, the Fraternity president made the following statement equating the posters to demeaning women:\n\n&gt;The Fraternity condemns the derogatory and demeaning language used on the banners. Such language has no place in our Fraternity or within any caring community, such as that of ODU\n\nIt is my view that no part of these banners were derogatory or demeaning to anyone. They might be vulgar because they carry a sexual implication, but implying a desire to have sex with women is not inherently demeaning to women. Equating vulgar language with demeaning women is also a fallacy."}

{"title": "CMV: Modern feminism is hypocritical and flawed", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3i9n2q", "selftext": "To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.\n\n1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest \"Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman\" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.\n\n2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase \"Victim Blaming\" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say \"Maybe that wasn't a good idea\" and then get off the hook?\n\n3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality\n\nOf course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.\n\nI've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense.

ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.\n\nWhat I can't understand is the last sentence:\n\n&gt;But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.\n\nHe seems to be saying that **only religion** can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.\n\nFor example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were \"just following orders,\" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.\n\nPoverty can make good people do evil things. \n\nDrugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.\n\n---\n\nLet me explain what I understand by \"good people\" and \"evil things.\" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?\n\nA \"good person\" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the \"outside force\" is religion.\n\nAn \"evil thing\" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. \n\nIn order to CMV, please:\n\n* convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.\n* show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.\n* show me that my definitions of \"good person\" or \"evil thing\" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).\n* anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

People get fed up with living under plutocracies that they feel they can't trust.\n\n* If democracy is a scale from 1-100, where that's a percentage of who gets to vote, so a dictatorship would probably be 0.000029%, and representative democracy might be 0.05%, then it implies that people who are partial towards democracy would prefer the ideal state of 100% democracy. If you prefer less than 100%, then you inherently think *some people don't deserve to have their desires represented*, and are by definition against the ideas of democracy.\n\n* There isn't a practical selection process whereby we could choose people to do what's best for others. A meritocracy is unachievable, because there is no good process to select them. Which leads us to --&gt;\n\n* If we think that people are smart enough to elect representatives, why are they not smart enough to vote on legislation directly?\n\n* Participation in sites like reddit prove that people want direct democracy; which in government would be the ability to create and vote on legislation as if it were a post. \n\nWhich is why representative democracies everywhere seem to have devolved into plutocracies. People are getting fed up with it, and starting to support non-establishment candidates or parties.\n\nWhich is exactly what we're seeing, in new political parties like the pirate party, podemos, syriza, which all tend toward direct democracy. Even countries without strong direct democracy movements, are having candidates trending in that direction: bernie sanders and jeremy Corbyn. \n\n\nIt seems inevitable that our governmental systems trend from power being concentrated in one person, to becoming more decentralized. If autocracy is at one end, and direct democracy is at the other, then representative democracy lies somewhere in the imperfect middle.\n\nTL:DR; People get fed up when the desires of their representatives clash with their own, and revolt against any concentration of power.\n\n"}

While on the job search I noticed that there were way more minimum wage jobs than actual careers and that the actual middle class careers were really hard to get into because they were sought after by so many people. I primarily looked on job boards like h2h.jobs and the local department of labor, but also applied on companies hiring portals that were known for providing well paying jobs. Further backing my anecdotal evidence was the fact that the city I was living in during my job search built a new shopping mall and a new walmart. Afterwards the politicians and several members of the community wrote letters to the newspaper boasting about all the new \"jobs\" that were created by the new shopping mall and Walmart and how much better the economy was doing. Additionally, there was a section in my newspaper about new businesses coming to the area - 82 to be exact. Each and everyone of these new \"businesses\" was a big box retail store, chain restaurant, or fast food restaurant.

{"title": "CMV: In the movie Jurassic World, Hoskins had a point", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3i7jvj", "selftext": "In the movie Jurassic World, Hoskins was the head of the park security who wanted to use the raptors for military purposes. He argued that the raptors obeying Owen proved they could be trained to hunt down the enemy, thus saving human lives who would have been risked by having to do it themselves. He later becomes one of the movie's villains (the Indominus was just an animal following it's instincts so it's not a villain even if it's an antagonist) by inviting the military into the park in a coup d'etat to control the situation.  They use the raptors to hunt down the Indominus, with the raptors obeying Owen, until they find it and realize it's part raptor. The raptors then turn on the soldiers, seemingly proving that they are too dangerous to use that way. Then Hoskins is killed by a raptor when trying to get the data on the project, which seems to be an ironic \"he got what he was asking for\". But then Owen manages to get the raptors to follow him again in his fight against the Indominus at the end. \n\nThe movie tries to send a message that was stated in earlier Jurassic Park movies, \"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.\" The hero doesn't want to use the raptors and they obey him. The military man who wants to use raptors to kill ironically gets killed by raptors.\n\nBut the raptors turning on the military was entirely based on the enemy being a giant raptor hybrid. Anywhere else in the world and the idea would have worked out great. The raptors proved how just four of them could decimate a group of highly skilled soldiers even when the soldiers knew what they were fighting against. And even after the raptors had turned on Owen, they showed their loyalty by coming back to him and fighting to the death for him. Which again points to them being very loyal against anything other than a giant alpha raptor. They are great soldiers and the movie shows this repeatedly while vilifying the one wanting them to be soldiers.\n\nedit: As a side note, even the Indominus wasn't a failure. Yes it turned on the people and went on a rampage killing everything that moved. It was smart and fooled everyone to escape it's cage (which I'd question why they didn't have better camera footage and just watch a replay to see what it was doing, why it was able to scratch the walls like that while the security guard was just chilling I have no idea). The movie showed how much of a monster the creature was while pointing at the man who made it with military use in mind and blaming him for making it. But the park staff were the ones who messed that up. They took an intelligent creature and fed it with a crane, never socializing it nor teaching it anything. It was like an abused child who didn't know right from wrong because no one ever taught it. If it had been raised with the care the raptors had it wouldn't have acted like that. And a giant raptor like that that would listen is again a great soldier.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think if you are an adult listening to it then you probably are immature. I don't think it's quality music, I think the screaming and horror-esque nature of their music is a shtick that is way over played. I don't think any mature balanced adult would listen and enjoy their music. \n\nEdit: I don't usually judge people on their music taste, I was in an aggravated state when I posted this.

{"title": "CMV: Age of consent laws are based on faulty anecdotes", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3i6pc0", "selftext": "Age of consent laws around the world vary dramatically, and even within the US there is a wide range of things that are acceptable or unacceptable depending on what state you are in. Most people are in support of age of consent laws, and will very aggressively assert that they want to protect the children. Many people will tell you that a sexual relationship between an adult and a child who is X years old is unquestionably damaging to the child, where X is usually a completely arbitrary number.\n\nThere is no doubt to me that an adult is capable of abusing a child in a relationship, and that the adult is capable of abusing the child in a way that the child believes they are consenting and does not believe they are being abused. I also believe that adults are capable of doing this to eachother in relationships where both people are of the consenting age.\n\nWhere things start to get shaky is the point when people start asserting that all sexual relationships are abusive once the 'victim' is below a certain age. I do not believe that there is sufficient scientific evidence to back up this claim. I do not believe that healthy sexual relationships occurring between adults and teens or children are given the proper room to breathe or prosper: as soon as a child is discovered to be in a sexual relationship with an adult, that child will be told repeatedly that their sexual partner is a bad person and that their sexual partner has abused them. I believe that this alone is sufficient to damage the child, regardless of whether the sexual relationship itself was damaging. Children are highly vulnerable to suggestion.\n\nI believe that more rigorous scientific investigation is necessary to justify the age of consent laws, and that once the scientific evidence comes out, the age of consent laws should be adjusted accordingly. I know that, as a teenage boy, especially by 14 (but even, to a smaller degree, as early as 8 or 9) I would have been excited to engage in a sexual relationship with an attractive female. I don't see how this would have resulted in abuse or psychological damage (assuming, of course, that my partner had my best interests in mind). But that's just the problem, it's nothing more than an anecdote. People who oppose my views also provide anecdotes.\n\nThe amount of scientific research in this area is lacking, and lots of the mania surrounding child abuse laws come from unproven ideas about child innocence and susceptibility to abuse. As an even bolder step, I believe most age of consent laws are largely baseless as far as genuine evidence is concerned. (as a side note, these beliefs also extend to other child abuse laws, and also extend to student-teacher relationship laws).\n\nPlease, CMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is a great deal of integration between Islam and modern society, but this isn't about the moderate majority. Also, terrorism and warfare in the Middle East are heavily fueled by politics.\n\nIf we accept that the Koran is the primary source of all that is Islam, and we accept that some (hundreds of millions?) individuals believe that the Koran is the unqestionable word of God, and we accept that the Koran clearly calls for the murder of nonbelievers (In the form of over 100 verses and the violent actions of Muhammad himself), then it follows that we've got a serious problem on our hands that will persist for as long as Islam remains. \n\nSo, what am I missing here? Why are we all tolerating it? Nothing we can do about it? Afraid we'll be murdered for speaking out? Even the most brutally honest public figures, like comedians, will never mention Islam.

I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all too frantic about the idea of war on the peninsula. I feel as if this conflict, whether it is dormant or tense or whatever, must be dealt with in the future and we're just kicking the can down the road.\n\n1. Many people would die, regardless. People are dying under the famines and in the concentration camps. The longer we wait, the more people will suffer and die. Taking action as soon as possible would cause a high death toll but can potentially be made up for it by the fact that we'd be taking action soon and not \"whenever unexpected situations lead us to.\" Plus, it's arguable that simply leaving things be is 'inhumane'.\n2. Long-term, a unified Korea would turn into an economic powerhouse. We have two countries with very strong work ethics, a country with a ton of technological advancements and billionaire tech companies, another country with a ton of cheap labor (that can help jump start the economy after unification), lots of natural resources that would offset the costs, and infrastructure that must be built in the northern half of the peninsula. Some experts say a unified Korea can surpass Japan in economic power.\n3. I highly doubt China would be as uncomfortable having a unified, US-influenced Korea on their doorstep like people say they'd be. It's not like people aren't able to fly from Beijing to Seoul or New York City; they're aware of lifestyle in first world countries. China and South Korea are, contrary to popular belief, close allies. The number of refugees who would attempt to cross the Chinese border would probably be minimal if China expresses force in the region and South Koreans distribute food effectively and quickly. Furthermore, they know they'd have to go through sex trafficking and risk of death if they want to go through China... and then go where?\n\nI have a very open mind when it comes to this issue. The reason why I am posting this is because I see others worrying a lot when seeing news of a potential resumption of war while I feel a sense of hope. But my thinking may be entirely backwards. I'd like to see opposing arguments to this topic. Thanks for reading!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I am always met with an argument that \"Anything can kill and you should probably hide in a bunk.\" or \"Driving is dangerous too\". Well, this is different. Driving is a necessity right now and I cannot wait for a day in the future where driverless car can save millions of lives. I can understand a show in a remote place where people consciously make the decision to take their kids and watch it. I am fine with that although it makes me question the human race. Are we so limited in finding ways to entertain ourselves that we're okay to risk lives of the pilot and innocent children who are not adult to make the decision themselves? People also bring the argument that the accidents like this are rare. A quick search on google tells me that such accidents happen every year. Again, how can you live with your conscience that something that you support and feel entertained has killed people and brought grief in someone's family. \n\nI am still struggling to find answer to this. How can you explain a show in Sussex where the people who died may not even be remotely interested in the airshow? It's a matter of luck. A brain freeze to a pilot and it's instant death depending where the plane might crash. Today, it's the road. Tomorrow it could be a school. Also, I have heard arguments that airshows provide money to the museum. Again, are we so limiting in our intelligence that we cannot find other avenues to fund the museum? I wouldn't lie that it's amazing to watch the feat we can perform in the sky and the adrenaline rush that people crave but when it has costed lives and traumatized people living in that city, it's one form of entertainment that we can totally live without.\n\nThank you.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Under the guise of an action movie George Miller has created a propaganda piece to unconsciously convince its audience of his political leanings. \n\n1. The appearance of the characters tells the audience what to think of them. Joe is covered in tumors and has a Darth Vader mask to look menacing and evil. The actresses who play his wives are all clean, healthy and models in real life.\n\n2. Immortan Joe never hurts any of his wives during the course of the movie, or uses violence to do anything but protect his family and friends. There is also no evidence to suggest he raped them or has physically abused them, as they have no bruises or scars except the grazed bullet wound from Max that they point out.\n\n3. Immortan Joe did not treat his wives as \"objects\" only for the purpose of bearing his children. Max is treated as an object only kept around for his blood and constantly chained up or in a cage. The quick pan of Immortan Joe's palace shows that there was a blackboard, books, a piano, and private quarters for the wives. This shows that he cared enough about them to provide for more than their basic needs to make him sons he wanted them to love him. \n\n4. Immortan Joe created a society in the middle of a nuclear wasteland. That must have been incredibly difficult, but he gets no praise for that only criticism. The vuvulani had a source of fresh and their own farms and they messed it up, but they don't get any blame. Immortan Joe is accused of having \"Killed the world\" despite having saved it and reestablishing a stable human civilization.   \n\n5. The wives write on the walls the reason they left was that they didn't want their sons to be warlords. But after realizing the green place didn't exist they decide its better to murder hundreds of people to take the citadel for themselves rather than to take 160 days to find a new place to live. In the 2 days that they have been driving they have seen 5 places that can evidently support human life. With the 160 days it is very likely they would find another. Once again they are let off the hook for this bloodthirsty rampage because they are depicted as the protagonists. \n\n6. Nux becomes a good guy because he gives up his religion and becomes an atheist. That is his entire character. \n\n7. Immortan Joe and the war boys become very upset about the death of the unborn fetus.\n\n8. Joe gives up significant strategic resources and strains relationships with his allies all in an attempt to get his wives and future child back. In any other movie that would be admirable and make him the hero. \n\n9. Despite water being a valuable resource needed to trade for guzzoline and for his farms, Immortan Joe gives it away charitably to the vagrants on the outskirts of his society and advises them not to become dependent on he generosity. \n\n10. In contrast many of the protagonist are only selfishly motivated. Max doesn't care about helping the wives escape, he is only doing what is best for himself. The group doesn't turn around to get the pregnant one who fell off and survived. The Vuvulani don't care about what is best for the people of the citadel they are only trying to put food in their own mouths.  They let Nux kill himself so they can escape, even before the engine was torn out the plan did not look good for him. \n\n**Things That Will NOT Convince Me**\n\n-statements from the director, cast, or those involved in the production about their intentions\n\n-any evidence from the extended universe, this was a stand alone work with a self contained story and should be analyzed as such.\n\nEDIT: PLEASE REFERENCE THE NUMBERS OF MY POINTS, IT WILL CONVINCE ME MORE IF YOU REFUTE THESE OR SUGGEST THINGS THAT IMMORTAN JOE COULD HAVE DONE DURING THE TIMELINE OF THE MOVIE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE MORAL"}

You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.\n\n2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.\n\n\nI do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.\n\nBut we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.\n\nI further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.\n\nChange my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

To expand, think of marriage and sex, it's between two people that are willing (and old enough) to give consent, so gay marriage fits these guidelines and therefore was legalized. So if you apply the same logic, incestual relationships should be legalized as long as the couple involved are of legal age of consent, but many will disagree because of the fact that the offspring of the incest couple will be more likely to be disabled (which is true), however, it's not illegal to have babies if you have illnesses such as Huntingtons.

However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.\n\n\n-Travel\n\nIt's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English.\nMost Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words.\nYou can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language.\nI don\u2019t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.\n\n\n-Media\n\nWhen it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. \nSpecifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.\n\n\n-Availability\n\nEuropean languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.\n\nFor an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.\n\nEast Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)\n\n\n-Difficulty\n\nEast Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.\n\nA lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is \u201clogical\u201d and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). \nIf you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.\n\n\n-Cultural benefits\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours.\nLearning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. \n\nEuropean cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Maybe you're asking a stranger to take a picture. Maybe a friend's phone died and they need to borrow yours. Maybe your mom needs it for a second, for whatever reason. What could possibly go through someone's mind thinking that this is a normal thing to do? Every time I see someone starting one of those threads I automatically assume they are socially awkward and don't spend time with people. "}
{"title": "CMV: There is no hope for mankind or this world, life is pointless and all our best efforts are empty, as nature is set up in a way that evil, destruction, and ignorance will always win in the end", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3i1qfo", "selftext": "Basically, I was looking at some YouTube videos from different places, doing some research on the internet, reading political polls, scientific polls, and reading about history and psychology when I finally reached a conclusion. Because of the way the natural world works, destruction, ignorance, and evil, will always win.\n\nLet me start out by saying, philosophically, I'm a cynic, fatalist (not in the spiritual predetermined sense, but more in the sense that the laws of nature predetermine reality), and an existential nihilist. Basically, nothing really matters, this world and especially mankind are hopeless, and despite our best efforts out struggles are ultimately sadly, but surely, futile. \n\nWhy do I say evil and destruction are predetermined to win? One simple fact, destruction is just so much easier than creation. I have some examples:\n\n1. Look at the Twin Towers, they took decades to build, had hundreds of construction workers, planners, managers, and businessmen that went into building them. Upon completion they housed thousands of workers and was a center for economics. Hundreds of workers, decades, and thousands of lives, all of that torn down because one day a couple hijackers with an airplane decided they wanted to hurt our country. In response our country then killed millions of their people. \n\n2. Next, nearly three years ago now, young children all went to enjoy just a comfortable day at school, they went to spend time with their friends, learn, and go home and tell their parents all about it. Some teachers watched over them. Love, care, money, billions of years of evolution, all of it ended when one day a deranged man decided the best way to make a point was to go to that school and end the lives of those innocent children and the teachers that watched over them.\n\n3. In our modern world, billions of years of evolution and biodiversity are being destroyed because the human race needs more and more. The planet we inhabit is far behind our singular, greedy goal of accumulating power and wealth. And then, rather than accept the hard truths, most humans would rather listen to the politicians that would happily stick a knife into their back. Billions of years of biodiversity, all destroyed within 500 years of industrialization. \n\nHonestly, in this world, how could goodness, creation, and knowledge possibly win? How could creation and life win if destruction and death is so much easier? How could knowledge and wisdom win if fear always drags people to ignorance? How could good win when the core of a human is entirely selfish? \n\nMy view is simply this, the world will not change, for it *cannot* change. It doesn't matter what happens, the victims will either always remain the same or switch out, destruction will always reign supreme, and fear and ignorance will always lead to one man killing another for his resources rather than working together to cultivate them. \n\nI implore you to change my bleak views, because, honestly, on a dying planet, as a member of a species that has begun to pride itself on ignorance, where things like race and sexual orientation matter more than survival and cooperation, where a group of friends can spend weeks orchestrating a magnificent picnic only for a maniac with a gun to decide their lives don't matter ending it instantly, I don't know what else to think other than that evil has such a massive advantage over good and will always come out on top."}

Parents in this day and age should have advice and information on what healthy eating actually is.

Parental failure to provide their children with adequate treatment for a chronic illness (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc) is a well accepted reason for a child protection registration for neglect. I believe that childhood obesity become a child protection concern when parents behave in a way that actively promotes treatment failure in a child who is at serious risk from their weight and when the parents or carers understand what is required. Even though others may point out the existence of factors such as the marketing of unhealthy foods, the primary responsibility falls on the parents every time. Existing laws could be applied."}

But until proven being a shadow of a doubt, should you not be detained in a location that is more humane and safe? At the very least, your on room with privacy and no danger.

I don't consider myself socially awkward in the least, but I am often quiet and have had a couple girls I know tell me I am \"aloof\" and \"reserved.\" Several girls I've been with have told me that I could get any girl I want based on my looks and intelligence, but instead of making me cocky, it hasn't done anything to improve my lack of confidence. I have a quick temper, but I'm good at controlling it. During the work week, I don't socialize much just because I don't have much time to. When I socialize on the weekends, I usually \"bro-out\" and go grab a few drinks with a couple of my buddies, although I do often get invited to large gatherings/parties and my friends almost always let me know if there's a big gathering happening. So basically, I'm not meeting girls on a frequent basis and I'm not really sure how to do it doesn't include drinking in some way or another. Sometimes I try to imagine what life would be like if I never get into another relationship to prepare myself for that possibility. I did well with the college hookup scene, but am clueless when it comes to post-grad socializing...\n\nThere are very slim pickings at my work for potential dates (by that, I mean there is only girl I would consider dating, and she is basically one of the guys) and I don't believe I'm going to find the love of my life in one of the dive bars near my house, so I am not meeting a lot of girls that interest me with my current lifestyle. I'm not interested in online dating, either, so I don't really have a lot of options, which is why I'm considering giving up.\n\n"}

I believe in a non-biased environment, a course covering religion (ancient myths to modern religion and secularism) is an extremely important subject to learn. Regardless of individual beliefs, religion has played a massive influence on art, culture, conflict, and civilization as a whole. In addition, with the ease of mass communication that we have now, religions are becoming much more mixed in certain areas. It is often the case that people, do to their environment, have certain incorrect presumptions about different faiths that are never discussed (e.g. \"Atheists are immoral individuals\", \"All Christians believe the earth is 6000 years old\", \"All Muslims are violent terrorists\"). I believe a course would help people understand more of other faiths, and perhaps cause them to question their own (which they may not have done) or consider others.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the great responses everyone!

{"title": "CMV: We Should Keep the Nipple Contained", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3i0ni9", "selftext": "I believe supporters of the \"Free the Nipple\" (FTN) campaign are miss guided. The movement's aim is to increase gender equality by ignoring our differences and allowing woman to show body parts everyone one in OUR society acknowledges as sexual. I believe that people should have the right not to be exposed, with-in reason, to sexual content in public. The human race is advanced enough to be able to acknowledge and celebrate our differences and create laws that address the real nature of things, as a society I believe we can have true equality and acknowledge we are all different. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom an ethical point of view the FTN campaign beliefs are too simplistic, they don\u2019t go into the real ethics behind the issue. FTN looks at the issue like this: Men are allowed to show their chest, to be equal women need to be allowed show their chest. But if we allow one group to show sexual parts of their body, which most people don\u2019t want to be exposed to without consent, are we more equal? Or less? Would men be able to show their testicles under FTN\u2019s reasoning? If women can show their sexual parts that people don\u2019t wanna see can men show their sexual parts that people don\u2019t wanna see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should accept our differences and create deeper laws that fit all, with true equality. Right now I think the laws we have are fair, there\u2019s no \u201cwomen can\u2019t show their breasts statute\u201d there are public decency laws. I think public decency laws are extremely fair they generally aren\u2019t specific, they let the society choose what is indecent and what isn\u2019t, I think the greater society should choose. If breasts weren\u2019t sexualised as much as they are in our society the laws we have now wouldn\u2019t prosecute free nipples. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough in most instances I believe the \"We shouldn't focus on this issue because there are bigger issues\" argument is wrong\u2026  we really should be tackling real gender inequality where there are actual principles being violated like the pay gap and female under representation in government. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Let\u2019s take the golden approach \u2013 try find absurdities,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t want a man or woman to flash their respective vagina/ penis a you or your kids, I think shown breasts are as sexually thought of as a vagina. If a man flashes his penis at someone it\u2019s quite fairly considered sexual assault. \nIf we take the simplistic approach that the FTP movement does, men and women should be treated exactly the same, woman wear G strings on the beach, then men can wear G Strings on the beach, if men wore G strings their testicles would show, try telling the mothers that their kids have to exposed to deez nuts to have an equal society \u2013 bullshit.\nCMV!

{"title": "CMV: The government should fully fund continuing education and certain degree programs that increase productivity.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3i0f06", "selftext": "The most important determinant of a country's standard of living is productivity. Since I've so commonly gotten this response, I want to dispel the notion that wealth is determined by relative skills and represents some finite pie to be divided in different ways; wealth is not a zero-sum proposition. While relative skills determine the proportion of the pie you receive, it has no bearing on the total size of the pie. Therefore, if more people were highly educated, a highly educated worker may not receive high wages relative to the average citizen, but those wages would buy significantly more because the workforce would be hugely more productive and efficient.\n\nLet's start with the low-hanging fruit. I think the easiest way to increase productivity is to help computer-illiterate people. How many people waste time each day typing out 10 emails instead of creating a group that automatically sends it out to a predefined list? How many people even use email filters? Given that the average person spends a few hrs per day going through email, I think teaching the less tech-savvy some shortcuts could realistically allow them to do in 2.5 hrs what they previously did in 3 hrs.\n\nSimple computer skills that could be taught in a three-day seminar and easily save millions of people 30+ minutes a day are not being taught. Instead, we are asking workers who may already be overworked to spend money and time doing something they may not even be sure has value. What if we pay these workers to get basic computer certifications or at least cover their tuition costs? Let's say we pay these workers $1,000 for a week-long course on some basic computer literacy. What's the ROI on that? Well, if they can spend 30 min less per day going through email b/c they know how to do some advanced queries, filter incoming emails, and automatically assign labels depending on who that email is from, that is their wage x money saved. If their wage is $10/hr, that generates an ROI in the first year alone ($5 per 30 min x 300 working days/yr = $1,500). This efficiency will continue to pay dividends throughout that person's working life. Let's say it would have taken 5 yrs for this person to learn these basic habits on their own - we will have increased productivity by $7,500 in that time ($1,500 x 5 yrs) by intervening and paying them to learn to be more productive.\n\nThis basic logic applies to areas where there are shortages of workers. Why aren't we paying people to learn computer science? Or nursing? Let's say it costs the government $100k to finance the degree. If they were previously making $50k/yr and now are making $70k/yr, they are generating $20k more per yr. If they have a 30 yr career in this field, they will add $600k to the economy over the course of their career. That's an easy investment to make and a noble one - educating and empowering the people through education.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Without one, you are reduced to giving the guy every valuable thing you have and hoping he's feeling nice at the end of it. In other situations, calling the cops. After all, when seconds count, the Police are only minutes away. I don't think the government can reasonably expect their citizens to place that much trust in them.\nAlso, guns are a tremendous equalizer. Barring unusual circumstances, a women is very unlikely to win a physical confrontation with a man. If she has a gun, and her attacker does not, she has a tremendous advantage. If the attacker does as well, they are evenly matched at worst. Significantly better odds than giving away all your stuff and placing your faith in human decency. This is also true for the elderly and any man of below average fighting prowess. Put simply, guns empower the weak and put them on even terms with the strong.\n\nI think guns are also a useful check on the government's power. To be clear, I am not some crazy redneck living in the mountains planning on toppling the government. It is simply an indisputable fact that mass ownership of guns is power to the people. Now, you may argue that \"the people\" are stupid and can't be trusted with that power. A valid perspective I suppose, though not one very compatible with democracy. If the citizens are armed, the state is much more limited in what they can do. There's a big difference between people throwing bricks at jack-booted thugs and shooting bullets. In countries with strict gun control, the government can push their people much farther before facing serious retribution. It tips the power balance strongly in favor of the government. Nobody is happy with the US government, but they could never descend to the level of actual tyranny before we overthrew them.\n\nAlso, an armed citizenry makes your country much more formidable in a war. The US obviously doesn't have to worry about that, but there's a reason no one ever messes with the Swiss. Fighting the entire population of a country instead of just the army is a daunting proposition, and a significant deterrent to would-be invaders. Not everyone has to be worried about this, but it is a factor.\n\nFinally, anyone who responds saying \"Lol, what's a rifle going to do against an M1 Abrams?\" really needs to google the words \"guerrilla\" or \"Afghanistan\". Or perhaps \"tactical literacy\".\n\n**Edit: Hey guys, I have to go take care of an errand, but I should be back in two hours or so. I'm having a lot of fun with this and hearing a lot of solid arguments, though Lord knows my karma is taking a hit. I am trying to respond to everybody, so please be patient.

{"title": "CMV: Hunting is an antiquated sport that should be banned.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hzg3y", "selftext": "First, what I refer to as \"hunting\" is the killing or trapping of any animal, with the purpose of doing so, as sport, whether it be to eat them as food or keep them as trophies. I am not talking about the regulated hunting of threatening species or the killing of animals in situations where they pose significant danger.\n\nRecently, we've seen the story of Cecil the lion become big news across the country and in the world at large. The fact that we as humans hold dominion over all other earthly creatures necessitates the notion of a responsibility we have in keeping balance and order to the food chain, considering that humans are the top of it. \n\nKilling for sport is something--one could argue--not inherent only in humans, but we've taken it beyond what it means if an animal were to kill another animal for sport just by sheer organization. I'm speaking of our current gaming rules and regulations in place, meant to keep this balance--one would want to believe--but a system well beyond anything an animal killing another animal for sport could come up with, for obvious reasons. And, as the story of Cecil the lion illustrates, the system governing wildlife from being hunted and killed is flawed, to say the least.\n\nIn regards to the act of hunting, and then using prey as food, I would argue that in our modern society, this is completely unnecesary, given the obvious institutions in place all ready, i.e., the supermarket. \n\nThe bottom line may be that hunting exists because we as humans enjoy it, it is thrilling to us, but should that condone its existence? We condemn the murder of humans. Why view other animals any different in that regard?\n\nAdmittedly, the quandary I have with my argument is that I feel it should be banned all over the world. However, due to the problems and beliefs of other societies around the world, some of which being so underdeveloped that hunting game is a valuable source of income, I have to limit my banning to the United States alone. By doing this, I'm brought back to the senseless killing of Cecil the lion, which was done in a different country. I argue, though, that it was carried out by an American, one who believed in the sport of hunting, who willingly paid tens of thousands of dollars to do it, and that, had he come from a society that looked down on the sport, he might not have had such determination to carry out what he did.\n\nLastly, I say it is *antiquated*, but that is a reflection of my opinion based on the notion that hunting was a means of surviving which is no longer necessary in our current society. This definition recognizes that at one point, there was a reason at some point in history for its existence, however. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV:Washing your hands after using the restroom as a woman is oftentimes unnecessary.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hwzsq", "selftext": "As a woman, I don't really get my hands dirty when I pee. I wipe myself with toilet paper, and very rarely do I actually touch anything with my hands other than toilet paper. If I do, I obviously understand the need to wash them, but that is not the typical case. After I use the toilet, most of the time, the flushing is done either automatically or with a long handle that I touch with my foot (because the handle is usually gross anyways). Some toilets with shorter handles do have to be touched, but usually those are personal toilets in my house that I know are clean. Perhaps I may touch the bathroom stall door, but I really don't think it's so disgusting as to warrant hand washing.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I usually do wash my hands after using the restroom. But I do it not because going to the bathroom is inherently dirty, but rather because my hands are dirty. I think it's important to wash your hands, after touching everything, once every few hours. So I see going to the bathroom as a kind of natural reminder that perhaps I should wash my hands soon. However, I drink a lot of water and go to the bathroom more often than I think I should wash my hands. If I wash my hands every time I pee, they get really dry (even with lotion) -- but I have to do it anyways in public restrooms because of societal conventions, whatnot. \n\n\nI know this is a dumb topic, and it isn't real a big deal in my life. I also see the overall societal benefit pretending you should wash your hands after going to the bathroom. And no, this isn't something I think about all the time.

{"title": "CMV: Much modern and contemporary art (i.e. non-figurative, \"ready-made\", conceptual etc.) is of profound and deeply expressive merit", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hwvqq", "selftext": "Thought I would flip the usual \"Modern art isn't real art\" stance around and present a muscular defense of the various 'radical' branches of 20th and 21st century art. Come at me with all you've got about the poverty of modern art! I'm going to start with a rebuttal of some of the common points raised against the worth of modern art, and then list some of the artists I like and why I like them.\n\n\nSo here's what I see as the commonly raised objections to the value of modern and contemporary art (the distinction between these two terms is somewhat ambiguous, but basically modern art is most of what was created from 1900-1960s, and then a shift to 'contemporary' art gradually occurred). \n\n\n* No effort/technical skill is required to create it\n\n* \"I don't get it/it's just colors\"\n\n* It's not pretty/beautiful\n\nPlease let me know of any others you can think of! But, to address these I've listed:\n\n\nFirst: No effort is required to create it. Yes, in many cases very little traditional technical skill is necessary to create any number of famous pieces of the last century. And by the same token, often very little quantifiable time or physical effort would have been necessary to create the same pieces. But why do we want art to require technical skill or effort? The answer seems to me that it makes worth quantifiable in terms of man-hours spent or technical skills applied - we assign worth to goods with money, and we earn certain amounts of money based on the time we work at a particular job. That feels simple - but actually we know when we think about it that even the apparently firm valuation possible with money is linked to arbitrary process - the economic status of the country which issues it, political contingencies and emergencies, the variability of market prices for goods and services, etc. And time itself is subject to the same instability - it zips by when we're having fun, and drags endlessly when we're working on a tedious task. Similar insights to these are driving factors in the way the artwork of the 20th century moved gradually away from traditional technical representation of subject matter. When we acknowledge that all processes of valuation are, at bottom, arbitrary, we are liberated from the requirement to adhere to traditional systems of valuation, but also forced to confront the problem of using any system of valuation at all. If all value is arbitrary, can we value anything? Is creation valuable? Life itself?\n\n\nThis brings us the 2nd objection: \"It's just colors/abstract\". A common whipping-boy for Reddit's typical reaction against modern art is Mark Rothko, whose monumental color blocks are often presented as a sort of \"Emperor's New Clothes\". And of course, while there actually is a great deal of technical canvas and paint ability which goes into Rothko's works, traditional figurative techniques are abandoned in them. But we must take note: the 'effort' Rothko is putting into his work is not technical effort but rather effort towards discovering a system of valuation which he can stand on and for after he has abandoned traditional systems. For Rothko, his paintings represented man's transcendental relationship with his own consciousness, a kind of pure, experiential expression of pure Being. It is noteworthy that the dominant philosophical trends of the time were phenomenology and existentialism, which were attempts to find a fundamental ground for consciousness in a newly modern world whose science had demoted God from his throne but neglected to nominate a new Fundamental Arbiter in replacement. So, while Rothko does not use traditional figurative techniques, his work is effortful in the sense that it tries to express a new sense of modern spirituality without God. Variations of the same can be said for much of the various avant-gardes of the first half of the 20th century; traditional artistic valuation was being abandoned (and concrete and universal measurement along with it), but the search for a new ground from and of which to create art was a consuming occupation.\n\n\nAnd finally, number 3, \"It's not beautiful/it's ugly\": This point obviously is answered to some degree by the points I've previously made - in dismissing traditional techniques, traditional standards are also held up to question. Beauty becomes something that is not necessarily inherent in a particular nude figure painted with particular colors and brush-strokes, if it is even something to be strived after at all. Duchamp's 'Fountain', among much of his other work, was a fairly direct critique of traditional concepts of artistic beauty, and later Conceptual artists would work with ideas which were in many cases almost totally devoid of physical manifestation, or any object with which to invest with traditional beauty. That doesn't mean many of their works are not beautiful however - the simplicity and poetic elegance of Hans Haacke's [Condensation Cube](http://www.macba.cat/en/condensation-cube-1523) would, I argue, meet many updated standards of beauty; a simple transparent figure which manifests changes in the heat and pressure of the room it is within it, providing a sort of spiritual residue of the minds and bodies which perceive and surround it. In any case, the gist of my rebuttal to this last point is that just as artistic techniques had to shift fundamentally to address our experience of living in the modern age, so did standards of beauty, and even the valuation of beauty itself.\n\n\nSo those are my initial defenses against some of the more common critiques of modern art - please do your best to pick them apart, as well as point out other points that I've missed. Take your best shot! But now that I've put up a defense, I'm going to launch a little offense - examples of some of my favorite artists of the last century, all having worked at some points at least in very untraditional mediums. Perhaps some of you will appreciate these artists as much as I do - and perhaps others of you will gain new fodder for the pointed attacks against my favorable stance towards modern art that I am hoping for!\n\n\nI love [Marcel Duchamp] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Duchamp_Fountaine.jpg). I love [Dieter Roth](http://blog.art21.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/moma_roth_literaturesausage.jpg). I love [Martin Kippenberger](http://www.markorton.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/kippenburger-moma-032809.jpg). I love [Bruce Nauman](http://inhalemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bruce-nauman2.jpg). All of these artists have in common their use of non-representational artistic techniques. Duchamp introduced the 'ready-made', and irreverently demonstrated the contingency of artistic value through his 'Fountain'. Roth frequently incorporated real food into his work, which inevitably would decompose and change form (and smell). His use of this material points towards the mortality and changeability of things, as well as linking the traditionally abstract realm of artistic production to the corporeality of bodily functioning. One of Martin Kippenberger's most famous pieces is his 'Happy End of Franz Kafka's America', which assembled dozens of pairs of chairs around desks on a sports playing field, with books commissioned by friends of the artists on many of the desks. The work is almost all 'ready-mades', so to speak, with most of the furniture being found and the books written by someone other than the artist, but that's exactly the point - Kippenberger's conception of the creativity of the artist rejected the traditional image of the solitary genius plucking ideas from the ether. Rather, art for Kippenberger was an inherently social function, a variable form of communication of the same type as talking or writing - although a communicative form of imperative spiritual importance. Kippenberger repositioned the artist within the social milieu from which he is at bottom inseparable. Nauman is a mercurial figure who works in many mediums - from sculptures that look like rags tossed in a corner to blinking poetic invocations in neon. What they have in common is an ambiguously anti-monumental sense; if art can be anything, as Duchamp demonstrated, then much of what the artist does in his art studio can be art, as Nauman intuited, even if appears to be trash or built in a gaudily commercial medium, or even if it's simply the act of walking around the studio itself. Here the social role of the artist creates the work as much as the artistic concept. Thus Nauman's dispersed and abject sculptures, or his [lists of neon words](http://beautifuldecay.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bruce-nauman-1-e1299486791926.jpg) which, as portions constantly blink on and off, modulate to new ambiguities the ambiguity already present in each phrase, demonstrate a freedom of creation bound to the realm of play opened by the identification of the artist with his social role.\n\n\nOK, so that's enough theorizing from me - change my view! Make me realize that modern art is worthless. I don't care how you do it, but I want to be feeling deep existential dread at the way I've wasted years of my life on a total void by the time I wake up tomorrow morning! Have at it. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In my case there were fewer classes than in the US.\n\n I only had around 5 classes and we didn't have them everyday. Maybe Monday I had two hours of math and then a two hour break then lunch then science then that was it for that day. \n\nWhat I liked the most about school in Sweden was the teacher-student relation. First of all they can dress guerre m however they want (and you know trendy swedes) and also students call them by their first name. It's a much more casual and friendly relationship. Teachers never tell you to be quiet or to put your phone away.\n\nAlso you have unlimited bathroom breaks. And you don't have to ask the teacher, you just leave as you need.\n\nNot to mention that swedes get paid around $100 a month to go to school, and during breaks, you can leave the school and come back for your next class.\n\nThe schools have more of a \"you're the one fucking up if you don't do things right\" kind of attitude. For the most part it works pretty well.\n\nThen here in the US teachers treat students like children. They herd us like sheep. They yell, they tell us to shut up, they tell us to put our phones away.\n\nWhy do they do this? I mean psychologically, students will behave the way they are treated.

Now I understand that \"hustlin\" can translate into any race/culture as just another medium in which to get money. But black culture seems to value poverty and the 'hustlers mentality'. If I turn on the radio to HOT107.5, I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype. \"Hustlin'\"  is glorified while education is not. \n\nThere is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty. \n\nHip-hop is attached to black culture, and it seems that black culture (which has churned out great literary works and ideas) cannot distance itself from hip-hop. I don't believe hip-hop is bad. Quiet the opposite, but it is the black community that has embraced the hip-hop scene and made the world associate it with us &amp; crime/street life. Even TV shows portray this, everything from sitcoms to drama. You are less likely to find the token-black guy, and more likely to find the 'reformed thug'. \n\nBlack people want to be included in mainstream society, yet reject it at the same time. We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises, but we also want black-only things. I believe you can't have your cake and eat it too.

We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\n/r/blackpeopletwitter, albeit funny, is also embarrassing because black people are again perpetuating a stereotype or being cast a stereotype. Tweets about is 'how fire is my mixtape, 'bruh' 'nigga this, nigga that'. We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying \"nigga\" and \"bitch\" like it's a pronoun. Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people. The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\" \n\n\n* Black nationalism\n\nIn my eyes, black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths. It is on the scale as 'white washing' history. Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by/for the black community. Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation.\n\ni.e. \"Ancient Egyptians were black, Jesus was black, Mohammed was black, etc\" or teaching talking about slavery only in terms of black v. white. \n\n\n* Homophobia/Racism/Misogyny\n\nAs I stated earlier, the black community hasn't made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip-hop culture perpetuates. All I can tell you is from my own experience but homophobia and misogyny  seems to be rampant in the black community. Not so much in terms of violent actions but insults through social media and subtle homophobic/misogynistic remarks made on radio and TV. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The draft should keep in line with the amount of women currently in service.

Knowing that a draft will include all young Americans will make our beautiful nation less quick to jump into foreign quagmires.\n\nThe Equality Argument: Women are included in the burden, playing a role proportionate to the military's current demographics. Women have proved capable in a variety of combat and leadership roles in militaries around the world, and the SJW generation could offer up a few fierce warriors (especially since a lot of fighting these days is done on a keyboard).\n\nThe Excellence Argument: With women in the draft, the 85% that are male can be selected more rigorously.

{"title": "CMV: I am racist against Gypsies", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hra98", "selftext": "I am racist against gypsies - There, I said it. When I say I'm racist I don't mean that I think they're an inferior group of people, or that they should be exterminated and kicked out of my country, it's just that I can't stand them. \n\n\nIn every country in Europe you have groups of people who are marginalized, profiled and suffer discrimination - Gypsies are frequently included on the list. And why is that? It's not because they have darker skin color, in fact I'd argue Gypsies are ethnically a diverse group with sub-ethnic group - It's because of their culture. \n\nIt's hard to not be racist against these people when everytime I see one of them on the street they will either beg and try to pickpocket you or try to sell illegal products (or legal products without license) and if you're lucky they won't threat you with a knife to handle the money.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on Gypsy neighborhoods, ghettos and places where they live, it's impossible to go in there without goods and leave in one piece, those are literally no go zones in my country and the police goes in there with a group of fully armored cops with MP5's (similar to SWAT in America).\n\nThey always complain about how racist society is against them, yet they don't allow their kids to go to mandatory school years and basically force them to work for cultural reasons. They complain about discrimination, but they have no problem starting a fight with you for no reason, and if you dare fighting back be 100% sure that they will call the entire family to kick your ass and possibly put you in a coma. There's no escaping that.\n\nYou are all thinking that I'm terribly racist, but this is the only ethnic group I have a beef with, I don't have problems with Africans who are a very discriminated group in my country as well - In fact, my girlfriend is half-Gypsy and I love her very much, but she was adopted and raised by a non-Gypsy family and so she doesn't have the culture in her - And trust me, if you think I'm racist you'll be surprised to know she hates Gypsies with a passion that isn't even comparable to what I'm exposing here.\n\nWhat should I do? I feel bad and terrible and evil, but I can't help it, it's the only group that I'm prejudiced against. Oh, and if it's relevant I was robbed by a group of 10 Gypsies when I was younger - I didn't lose valuable goods, but it affected me deeply.\n\nIf people want to be integrated in society, they need to minimally adapt to cultural norms. Of course people don't hire Gypsies, no one wants to risk hiring someone who, at the slightest disagreement and beef with you can call an entire family to kick your ass. Oh, and obviously not speaking native tongues with a proper accent and lacking basic education because your parents voluntarily choose to deprive you of it also doesn't help.\n\n\n\nEDIT - Some people are having problems with me using the word racist to describe myself, I think it is accurate because not all racism is supremacy and there's subtle and institutional racism, but if you don't agree with the use of the word you can still address my prejudice because the word used to describe it is not that important, what's important is how I feel about this group of people"}
{"title": "CMV: Iran getting nuclear weapons would not be a huge disaster", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hqw60", "selftext": "The common assumption and statement repeated by politicians (at least in the U.S. and Israel) is that a nuclear Iran is completely unacceptable. I agree that it will be an inconvenience and complication, and a negative for Western interests, but it will not be a disaster. Iran obtaining nukes may actually encourage internal liberalization/reform. A nuke provides ultimate protection from invasion. Hardliners use the threat of invasion to scare people away from reforms, so their position would be weakened by having a bomb.\n\nAnticipated replies:\n\n - If Iran has a nuke, it will (try to) destroy Israel.\n\nIran would not use a nuke because that would be absolute suicide. The country would be invaded and the leadership executed.\n\n - Iranian leadership is not rational, and will do it anyway.\n\nIranian leadership has shown itself to be very rational. Yes, it uses terrible rhetoric and incites hatred in its people as a means of control. However, their strategy seems similar to Nixon's [\"Madman theory\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory) - act like you're crazy to get more out of negotiations.\n\n - Iran will give nuclear material to terrorists\n\nThis would still be suicide. There is an extremely high likelihood it would be traceable back to them. Besides, while they are happy to sponsor terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, they would have no interest giving away a superweapon to an unpredictable third party.\n\n - A nuclear Iran would cause a nuclear arms race in the Middle East\n\nThis is the phrase generally used, but as far as I can tell the only one \"racing\" would be Saudi Arabia. However, Saudi Arabia is both a U.S. ally (and could work out a defense pact if Iran had a bomb), and has no nuclear infrastructure, which apparently (considering that Iran has been \"a year away from a bomb\" for 20 years) takes a long time to create. Furthermore, I'm skeptical of an arms race since Israel and Pakistan already have nukes and this has not caused one.\n\n- Iran will become more influential in the region, which is bad because it funds terrorists.\n\nHaving a nuke would only increase its influence because it would be able to act without the threat of a U.S. invasion. However, this is hardly different from the status quo, where it is common knowledge that there is little public appetite for an assault on Iran's borders. The U.S. and allies are currently engaged in proxy conflicts with Iran; Iranian nukes would not change these conflicts. For example, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. engaged in such conflicts but kept nukes to themselves.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Computers should become less user friendly in the future", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hq1tc", "selftext": "Hello. I think a vast majority of our security problems on our networks and computational devices stems from technical illiteracy from the everyday user. \n\nAlso, the functionality of a computer nowadays is being restricted heavily by catering computers to the lowest common denominator of computer users, ie \"I just borrowed my grandsons computer to send a virtual e-mail to Susan\".\n\nPoints:\n\n-Computers have become easier to use, but generally do this by removing choice, not by improving usability. Most people these days do not know how to do simple tasks on computers. How do you instruct a computer to copy all files that start with July and end with .jpg from a folder and all it's subfolders to a separate folder titled \"Camping Photos\"? \n\n-The population of Americans who are brand new to computing is shrinking every day, and will continue shrinking due to death. As such, it is illogical to have them be the standard to which software is designed. \n\n-People who have had computers available their entire lives are incapable of troubleshooting the machines that they've grown up with from a small age, as their interactions with the machine have been simplistic and uninteresting. How many times have you seen someone \"link\" to a photo or a document by saying; \"Here, click this: C:\\Users\\JCena\\Files\\pr0n.gif\"\n\n-Modern computers have many abstraction layers that separate a user from the actual actions being taken. People develop metaphors for interactions with machines, and some of these become standards. For instance, I won't sit here and tell you that the \"Files and folders\" metaphor  for organizing information on machines wasn't successful. Microsoft is especially guilty of this. What is a \"briefcase\"? When I say \"Library\", are you thinking of \"That folder that isn't a folder that contains shortcuts to all my shit\", or are you thinking \"A file full of programming functions that allows a programmer to utilize features without having to write it all themselves\"?\n\n-By hiding machine functionality, the quality of that functionality degrades (or at least, doesn't improve). \n\n-The \"user friendliness\" leads to a paradigm where users are not expected nor required to in any way expend any effort in learning how to use a machine that they will be using a lot. This means users are dumber, and more likely to break things. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

And *generally* cheating is wrong, but it isn't always wrong. Maybe it's an open, non-monogamous relationship. Maybe the guy was cheating with the blessing of his wife.

Maybe we as society shouldn't be in the position to judge other people's personal lives just because we disagree with someone else's action. Just because you don't want to be cheated on it doesn't mean that you can judge cheaters who were in some situation that you know nothing about and are in no position to pass judgement on. \n\nThese people have a right to privacy. The internet leaking into people's lives ruins thing for people permanently. There was a vox(?) article about the lives of people who twitter has shamed after their shaming. I worry that the response to this leak is going to be out of proportion to the general social backlash that a cheater receives. Normally when someone cheats (without the consent of their SO) their relationship ends and that is more or less the extent of it. The nature of this leak is such that it will expose thousands of people to blackmail and professional consequences all for something that while, morally unacceptable in our society, is not criminal.  \n\nAlso look at the fucking hypocrisy.

{"title": "CMV: I'm a straight male against dating bisexual women.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hn3ww", "selftext": "I am a 100% straight male, as in, I'm ONLY into straight women; lesbians gross me out, though I don't care who's into who or who wants to marry each other; people should be free to do as they wish. Basically, I have a hard enough time as it is with straight women and a \"bisexual\" girl is triple the drama, with no added benefits. I've never been into 'bisexual' women and if I'm attracted to one or she's attracted to me and I find out she's into women or has sex with them, it's pretty much a deal-breaker from then on. I then just feel betrayed afterwards, thinking I was a fool for going after a girl who wants a girl (instead of me). \n\nMy biggest concerns if I dated a 'bisexual' girl are:\n\n* **A.** Any girl who claims to be 'bisexual' would want a woman *way* more than she would ever a guy. She literally has double the options to potentially cheat or leave me for someone else, and cheating/being dumped is even a problem in straight couple relationships. (*I'm a guy and even I don't know why women would want us over other women and their soft, supple bodies just made for giving and receiving pleasure.*)\n\n* **B.** Constantly having to compete with women for her attention. (*I can't compete with boobs!*)\n\n* **C.** A 'bisexual' girl's very likely (in my view) not going to be monogamous, and I'm not into three-ways, lesbians, or an \"open relationship.\"\n\n* **D.** A 'bisexual' girl's very likely to not *want* a relationship; just casual sex and \"fooling around.\" (*Men on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and women on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and the weekend, I'd assume.*)\n\nAnd I'm sexually inexperienced, so unlike the 'sexually advanced,' I don't have this whole \"rainbow of sexuality Kinsey scale\" level of experience behind me. If I had orgies and stuff, and banged every type of human being alive and had notches in the triple digits by now (at age 28), maybe I'd be more understanding of it all. But I'm pretty vanilla and virginal, at this point. So I don't get the whole \"Kinsey sex scale\" stuff beyond \"Straight\" and \"everything else (LGBT, etc).\"\n\nTo be honest, I *barely* even accept \"bisexual\" as a real thing. (It was never spoken of in society until around 10-15 years ago; now every other woman claims to be \"bi\" and says how much she loves going down on women.) But since science backs it up, I have to back it up as being real, as well. No matter how much I can't comprehend simultaneously being into both men and women at the same time, equally. I literally cannot even comprehend that; it's so far from what I'd personally want, sexually speaking.\n\nHowever, with all this said, I am also a big hopeless romantic. My ideal girl, physical traits aside, would be kind, sweet, gentle, caring, loving, open-minded, an easy-listener and a best friend. Mainly, I want a girl just to be into ***ME*** and no one else. And the argument from the other side I've heard before are that 'bisexuals' (and pansexuals) tend to be more loving, compassionate, kind, and open-minded, as they judge less on the person's outer exterior and more on their inner personality. \n\nAnd the *reason* I am so sexually inexperienced is [me](http://imgur.com/UOd924K) being a short, 5'11\", overweight, ugly, dark-skinned man that literally no straight woman would ever call \"sexy\" or \"good looking.\" So if the whole theory that \"'bisexuals' (and pansexuals) are less shallow and more into who a person truly are,\" then they would be a *more suitable choice* for me to go after, assuming this is true.\n\nSo, I think that covers it all. I'm open to changing my mind on it, if people are intelligent and open-minded enough to convince me why I could potentially be wrong about my stance on 'bisexuals.'"}

{"title": "CMV: The best strategy on Cutthroat Kitchen is to dogpile.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3hmpv3", "selftext": "Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the money remaining.  Often, this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged.  E.g. \"One of your opponents will give up all their ingredients and have to make their tacos using just what they can recover from this day old salad bar.\"\n\nThis view is about what the best strategy for handing out a sabotage is.  I think that in the first 2 rounds, when you have a choice, you should always target whoever already has a sabotage.  So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar, and then you're handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil, you should always pick the person who got the salad bar.\n\nThe reason is this: you do not win a round of CTK.  You just refrain from losing.  Having the best dish is no better than having the second or third best dish in round one.  You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally.  Because then they go home.\n\nSpreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they'll be crippling (since they're tested to be doable).  If you pile them all on one person though, it becomes much more likely they'll totally fail, thus saving you.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Homo sapiens is in the end of its evolutionary path", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hma66", "selftext": "Human being can not evolve further. \n\nEvolution requires environmental stress in order to select better adapted traits to spread to the population. Over time this spreading of traits drives evolution forward. \n\nAt this point in time, most people (especially in the developed world, but not excluding the developing world) has access to limit or even remove environmental stress from their lives altogether. Some broad example: heating and cooling system, medicine, nutritious food. Better access to these allow individual with less adapted genes to survive and procreate. \n\nFurthermore, current social system hinders natural selection. In monogamous relationship, the chance of a person with better traits to procreate roughly similar to those with worse traits. Another example is that social security shares the risk through out the society: let's say a kid with diabetic can procreate and pass his/her gene to the gene pool because of access to treatment and medication (as opposed to in the wild, they most likely will not survive). I am not saying this is bad, but these characteristics dampen natural selection, thus evolution. \n\nTaking these into consideration and without any apocalyptic situations, I think human can not evolve further and we are basically evolutionary dead end. \n\nPlease, correct my view. \n\nEDIT 1: people with obesity apparently have reduced chance of procreation (as per http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2970793/) which means their genes have a higher chance to be removed from the gene pool. This change may change Homo sapiens as a species. Evolution is still moving forward.\n\nEDIT 2: the very things that remove the environmental stresses (temp control, nutrition, basically our current lifestyle) may eventually bring about the apocalyptic scenario on a massive scale, forcing Homo sapiens evolution.\n\nEDIT 3: Thanks Reddit!

{"title": "CMV: Only registered members of a political party should be permitted to seek and obtain that party's nomination for elected office.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hl45h", "selftext": "The 2016 US presidential primary race is well underway, and the large pool of candidates in both major political parties is exposing a significant gap in the nominating process. Some of the leading candidates are of questionable party affiliation (e.g. Donald  Trump is now a registered Republican but has faced criticism for switching parties throughout his lifetime; Lincoln Chafee was a Republican while serving as a Mayor, Senator, and Governor, and only became a Democrat in 2013) or are unabashedly independent of any party affiliation (Bernie Sanders is not a registered Democrat but still running for the Democratic nomination).  \n\nThis has led to a lot of controversy on both sides about throwing the weight of the party behind someone whose allegiance to the party is questionable, and with good reason. For the following reasons, I believe that by law only registered members of a political party should be able to seek and obtain that party's nomination for elected office. \n\n1) Parties spend a substantial amount of resources to try to elect their nominees. These resources often come from contributions (in terms of money, activism, work hours etc) governed by election law made by party members or supporters to support fellow party members. It is inappropriate to allocate these resources to someone who, despite achieving the nomination, is not even a member of the party in the first place.\n\n2) Many third parties with access to general election ballots often nominate the same person, which causes that individual to appear on the ballot several times for the same position. This duplication is unfair to candidates from other parties (especially third parties) who may only appear on the ballot once. For the purposes of the official ballot, parties should only be allowed to formally nominate their own members, or no one at all. \n\n3) The members of a political party's presidential ticket are the de facto leaders of their national party during and (if elected) after the election. The same principle applies for nominees for Governor at the state-level, Mayor at the municipality-level, etc. Nominees' political positions are often absorbed into the general party platform, which can impact elections and party voter turnout elsewhere. It is nonsensical, and unfair to party members, for their de facto leaders to be from another party or no party at all, especially given that nominations are mostly a function of popular vote. (Tangentially, I am also opposed to \"open primaries\" where voters who aren't registered members of a political party can still vote in that party's primary election, but I suppose that's a topic for another CMV post. And of course, it should continue to be against election rules to be a registered member of more than one political party.)\n\n4) There is nothing wrong with or prohibitive about running for office as an independent. Ross Perot staged a pretty successful third party run for president in 1992. Sanders is the longest serving independent in the Senate. Many other people have been elected to political office at various levels of government without obtaining a major party nomination. Our political system does not preclude independents from winning elections, so any argument that an independent's only real chance of winning is to seek the nomination of a party with which (s)he does not formally affiliate is historically and demonstrably invalid. \n\nCMV.\n\n**Edit:** I understand a lot of people on reddit are Bernie Sanders supporters, and that my view might argue against his candidacy in the Democratic primary. For the record, I am not a Clinton or a Trump supporter; nor am I decidedly against Sanders as a candidate if he makes to the general election. I hope my replies are not being downvoted (against this sub's rules) because I am not 100% in favor of Sanders.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The way our society is currently structured, a woman has 100% control over what happens to a baby, regardless of circumstances regarding conception. She can choose to carry it to term or she can choose to abort it. The male has few rights and none of them concrete in most countries - in the past, virtually every lawsuit to initiate or prevent an abortion has failed.\n\nI think this is good. I think a woman should have full rights to control her body, and the pregnancy is *definitely* a matter of bodily autonomy. The child that ensues as a result, however, is not. I think, regardless of circumstances of conception, the biological mother/father should be able to opt out of parental rights and responsibilities. At birth, the baby will be delivered/retained by the person who did not sign the waiver, and raised by them - and them alone. Any visitation rights/contact/influence will be at the discretion of the now sole legal guardian.\n\nThis way, mothers who don't want the child but may be opposed to an abortion (for whatever reason) can surrender the child to the father without worrying about any legal ramifications. Similarly, any male who doesn't want to participate in the raising of the child should be able to sign a form and waive all legal rights and responsibilities including child support.\n\nThis is based on the logic that most pregnancies that are unwanted are either \"accidents\" (I.E. Nobody's fault, condom broke, hormonal B.C. failed, they were stupid and didn't even pull out, etc...) or intentional (Poked holes in the condom, raped, lied about B.C.). I don't believe there are many pregnancies where one party was solely at fault, though I may be wrong on this. As a result, if they choose not to be a part of/don't want that child, I think they should be absolved of pregnancy/birth/child rearing fees.\n\nI don't think either party having to take responsibility for something they didn't want/didn't intend to happen is right. I think that our current system is pretty fucked, honestly, especially because of incidents like [these](http://www.ageofconsent.com/comments/numberthirtysix.htm). While rare, and definitely not the norm, the idea that *anyone* can pay so heavily for something they didn't legally consent to is pretty shocking.\n\nNote: This should only apply to jurisdictions where abortion is legal. Any place where it isn't, both parties are conceivably being forced to bear the pregnancy, and any costs associated with bearing it should be split. That's only if it's going up for adoption, of course.\n\nTL;DR - You shouldn't have to pay for a baby if you didn't want the baby and just got unlucky/were stupid.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: There is nothing wrong with awarding participation trophies. In fact, rewarding participation is essential to preparing children to be citizens of a democratic state.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3him2z", "selftext": "NFL retiree James Harrison is facing controversy after he stripped his children of participation trophies, i.e. \"trophies for nothing\". The result has been a bitter debate on Twitter under the hashtag #TrophiesForEveryone. The big problem is that this is a false dichotomy:\n\n1) Awarding trophies for participation =/= not awarding extra special trophies for winning. Victory and accomplishment deserve to be celebrated, but so does being part of a team and of a larger whole.\n\n2) Adult society awards both victory and participation. [When did you last get one of these](https://thestruggleembraced.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/i-voted-sticker.jpg)? This is essentially a participation trophy; as long as you are an adult US citizen without (depending on the state) a felony record, you can get one of these every year just for showing up. But does that make them any more hollow? Do we only congratulate people who vote for the winning candidate? In fact, \"participatory\" is a huge buzzword in everything from design to governance, reflecting that we in the West do not aspire to a winner-take-all, might-makes-right society, but instead encourage the *broadest range of participation*, even if it means that the losers get to have their voice heard.\n\n3) A participation trophy is not necessarily the PC SJW \"Everyone's a Winner :)\" thing that it is sometimes made out to be.

{"title": "CMV: Philosophy is Not Distinct from the Scientific Method", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hiaiz", "selftext": "First, I'm not saying philosophy is useless. I'm claiming that everything of use in philosophy is included as an integral part of the scientific method.\n\nWhat we normally refer to as the distinction between philosophy and the scientific method is really a matter of degree and not of kind. A good philosopher takes observations about reality and tries to fit them into a logical scheme of explanation that is consistent with everything that has been observed in the past. That *is* the scientific method - or, more accurately, it is a part of the scientific method. The extra part is the empirical work of trying to validate the explanation (or hypothesis) by making further observations.\n\nI'm arguing that what makes us call something \"philosophy\" instead of \"science\" is the distance the conclusions are away from the observations being used. If we are musing about the theoretical possibilities of a probability density of quarks, then we're doing science. If we're musing about what kind of actions lead to living a content life, then we're doing philosophy. The only difference being to what degree our hypotheses have to rely on logic alone to extend their reach because available and confirmed observations for such complex subjects are still way beyond our reach. We're still doing science. We're just out on the ledge.\n\nI think the only reason this is even confused is because of a historical coincidence. We discovered philosophy first. It makes sense, because at the time the range of empirical observations we had available to us was tiny. I argue we discovered religious hypotheses first because they only need intuition to get off the ground. The next thing that would occur is the discovery of logic. We still can't build particle accelerators, but we can start to get serious about self-consistency in our arguments from intuition. This helped, but we still had another breakthrough to make. That was the scientific method. Where we finally realized that logic and intuition must be tempered by careful and exact measurements. Otherwise, it will all just collapse into my seemingly self-consistent logical framework versus your seemingly self-consistent logical framework - or as we usually refer to it: the Middle East conflict (it has many other names).\n\nAnd so because of the circumstances of history, we came to see the scientifc method as separate from the philosophical method. They even referred to science as \"natural philosophy\" at first. It soon became clear that this wasn't just another aspect of philosophical study. I think the situation was the exact opposite. Everything useful in philosophy is contained within the \"forming a hypothesis based on existing information\" part of the scientific method. In this sense, philosophy is distinct from biology. Biology is a specific application of the scientific method. Philosophy is a key part of the process, but it does not exceed the process.\n\nOr at least I think it doesn't. Change my view!"}
{"title": "CMV: Spotify is far inferior to other music services, and Google Music should be its replacement.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hiai7", "selftext": "Most people have heard of and use Spotify, many of my friends included. I've tried and tried to like Spotify but after using a ton of other music services, I've concluded that Spotify is incredibly terrible and doesn't deserve the fanbase it has. Since Spotify and Google Music are priced the same ($9.99/month), I'll compare the two. I'm using the web version of Spotify, so maybe the desktop app got way amazing since I last used it a year ago. But my criticisms are specific to the web app.\n\n**Web version is very under-maintained**: First of all, Spotify comes in desktop, web, and mobile forms. The web version is not maintained very well, and doesn't support rearranging playlists or dragging at all, nor does the UI respond well when deleting a song from a playlist. When I delete a song, the song after the deleted one shows as playing, but it's not. The song I deleted is still playing. I have to click away from the song and click back just to have it showing the right song playing. (This is on both Windows and Linux.)\n\n**The right-click menus are bad**: The menus when you right-click on songs in a playlist are not intuitive. When I right-click and select \"Save\", I don't know where I'm saving to. Adding to playlist requires two clicks. You can Play and Add To Play Queue, but you can't Play Next. There is no option to skip duplicates when adding to a playlist, it just silently adds the duplicates without asking.\n\n**Searching and selecting songs is a multi-step process**: I want to search for a song and immediately add it to my queue or playlist. I don't want to have to click on it, wait for it to load, right click the song, and THEN add it to my queue. That is twice as many steps as there needs to be. \n\n**The UI is pretty terrible**: Clicking on the burger bar on the right-hand side brings up the Play Queue, but while you're on the queue you can't see anything else. And clicking away to anything but the left sidebar is impossible. I have to click the back button just to go back to where I was. And this makes it impossible to see the queue update as you add songs without multiple clicks, as well as making it impossible to drag songs onto the queue. (This, to me, is much more intuitive and easy than being forced to right-click to add songs.) You can't select multiple songs, you have to add/delete one at a time.\n\n**Bad offline download policies**: Spotify Premium allows you to download songs to your device...but only for a maximum of 30 days offline. I don't know if you just have to go back online to keep the songs, or you have to re-download them, but it's pretty inconvenient to come back to find that a bunch of songs you thought you had aren't there.\n\n**Laughably horrible selection of music and stations**: This was the first thing I noticed when using Spotify for the first time. Any artist even slightly underground has entire albums missing from the collection (e.g. Pere Ubu, Odesza). And searching for an artists brings up an incoherent blob of song results (e.g. Nick Cave). I have to individually select whether I want \"Nick Cave\" or \"Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,\" because when I look at the song list, the first eight (EIGHT) songs don't even have Nick Cave listed as the main artist. And there aren't a lot of radio stations to choose from, unless I'm missing something. Just artist-based radio and a couple of genre-based stations. A lot of playlists though; I'll give them that.\n\n**Google Music is better**:\n\nFirst of all, you can add your own music libraries to Google Music, so if there is something missing you can just supplement it with your own copy of the song you want. You can add it into your playlists seamlessly. You can sync your libraries across all your devices (I have ten million computers, and I have music saved from all of them. And the songs are still there even after I stop using my old computers.) Also, if some songs are missing, there is Youtube integration which will probably have the video somewhere for that song. Even besides all that, the music selection is much, much better than Spotify. The only better selections I've seen are Youtube (which is covered in Google Music) and Grooveshark (RIP 2015 **:(** ). There are also a ton of radio stations for almost any mood/genre you could think of, along with a bunch of playlists available along with any search results. You also have \"My Library,\" where you can save songs and albums so you can easily find them later. I'm not sure if Spotify Premium has this.\n\nThe web and mobile versions work as expected; they are both maintained equally and both have the same features. And the glitches found in Spotify are missing; deleting a song from a playlist automatically plays the next song without having it show some other song playing instead. And the play queue can be brought up in the lower corner of the screen, so you can scroll around on the main screen while your queue is still up. Unlike Spotify's web app, you can drag songs around in your queue and playlists, and you can drag songs from the search results directly into playlists, something which requires the multi-step right clicking frenzy I mentioned. You can also \"Play Next\" along with \"Add to Queue,\" which Spotify doesn't seem to have. And of course, unlike Spotify's web app, you can select multiple songs at once and add/delete them as you wish.\n\nOffline playing is a lot less locked down. The downloads are yours for as long as you have the paid service, with no 30-day limitations. You can select whole playlists for download, and it will auto-sync whenever you add a new song to the playlist, and automatically download it. You can, of course, download individual songs as well. You can \"Add Playlist to Playlist,\" which is useful for when I want to pare down my ten thousand playlists into one master playlist. Spotify makes me do it one by one. And Google Music actually asks you if you want to skip duplicates...unlike Spotify.\n\nLast but not least, you can use it without being signed in to a special service. If you're signed into google (which, if you have gmail, you probably are), you can use it. You don't have to make a separate account or link anything to Facebook.\n\n*Things I don't like about Google Music*:\n\n1.) You can't yet add Youtube videos into your playlists. They have to be played separately. \n\n2.) You can't drag search results into the queue. The only service I've seen that did this was Grooveshark (RIP **:'(** )\n\n3.) You can't use your queue to \"Save As\" an existing playlist. The only service I've seen that can do this was, you guessed it, Grooveshark. (RIP)\n\n*Possible Objections*:\n\n1.) *No one uses the web app!*: Well, I use it because I don't want to download an extra program onto my computer. I'm sure if I was a true Spoify fan, I would. But I argue that since the web app is the first to be seen by people new to Spotify, you'd think they would put more effort into making it actually functional. They openly admit that their web app is less maintained. And even if you do use the desktop app, if you happen to want to do a quick check-in without loading up the desktop app, maybe move around a song or two in a playlist before a party, you can't do it. Any songs you add automatically get added to the end of the playlist no matter what. For a simple thing like that you have to load up your big old desktop app.\n\n2.) *But Spotify has the friends feature!*: Obviously, the answer to this is to use last.fm to scrobble your music. Last.fm has extensions that scrobble music from *all* your services, not just Spotify. You're essentially locked into Spotify for all your music if you want your friends to have an accurate view of what kind of music you listen to. And Last.fm shares your scrobbles with everyone, not just signed-in people on your friends list.\n\nSince Spotify seems to be the de facto standard for most people in my 18-24 age bracket, please CMV and let me see what the fanboys see.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump gain popularity from the same underlying reasons", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hi4jt", "selftext": "This is how it appears to me as a non-American. In effect, people are moving to support these two candidates mostly in response to the same set of events:\n\n- Disillusionment with the political establishment. Voters are fed up with the highly polished and spin doctored politicians, with overtly similar views, that make up the rest of the leadership candidates. Moreover they feel the insularity of groups within political circles leads to a strong divergence from doing what is best for the people to doing what is best for the elite. In response they support people with seemingly strongly felt policy proposals, messages, and who have only - if at all, existed at the forefront of mainstream politics.\n\n- A response to the emergence of political dynasties. Hillary and Jeb both feel like rehashes of past presidents, and voters fear an arrogance and weakening of democracy if familial dominance is extended.\n\n- Anger at cronyism and corruption. Support for people percieved to fall less into donor's pockets. Sanders stands against this kind of \"selling out\" and Trump would seem to be rich enough to fund himself. (Reality isn't important here, only what people think).\n\n- Upset at being left behind financially. Sanders talks about raising the minimum wage, organising co-ops and unions and making trade deals beneficial to the American people. Trump talks about forcing companies to situate factories in the USA, especially in cities on steep decline like Detroit. Voter feel these two\n\n- Upset at the pace of change. (This goes in alternate directions so may be less suitable). The USA is deeply split in its range of ideologies, Obama felt it prudent to oppose Gay marriage officially when he first ran for President due to this in order to gain enough votes. With Trump, to quite Iain Dey in the London Times \"Large numbers of Americans are struggling to get their opinions up to speed with the liberal agenda and they are fed up with being ignored...[which] is why a candidate currently percieved to be a joke is leading the race for the Republican presidential nomination\" . Conversely others feel that Sanders would push their nation towards a more tolerant and open nation, and more supportive of minorities and the less well off.\n\nSo please, change this l'il Limey's view that these two candidates gain support for offering their (differing) responses to many of the same problems.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

These groups are varied in such dramatic ways that there is little similarities between them. Ethiopians are not like Nigerians, Irish are not like Russians, Japanese are not like Burmese, it is an inaccuracy to try and group them together based on physical characteristics such as complexions, and hair types.

{"title": "CMV: IDs should be required to vote", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3hgl6d", "selftext": "There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.\n\n\nPoint 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx\nThe ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.\n\nPoint 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.\n\nPoint 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. \n\nPoint 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards."}

Two obvious examples that come to mind are the US Government attempting to prosecute Edward Snowden under the 1917 Espionage Act, and the way that RICO laws have been used against everyone from Anti-Abortion protesters to divorce cases.\n\nIn the words of James Madison: \"Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes; and armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war, and in the degeneracy of manners and of morals engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.\"\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Don\u2019t you think if people could magically wish away such impediments, they would have already done so? It\u2019s possible that some people are able to do this \u2013 but then they presumably wouldn\u2019t be in need of such banal advice. \n\nBut even if you are held back by anxiety / hiding behind a fa\u00e7ade etc. \u2013 are these things not an integral part of the ego that constitutes the \u2018self\u2019? Wouldn\u2019t someone co-existing with these neuroses be closer to their \u2018true self\u2019 (whatever that is) than someone trying to change their mental state? Perhaps. Though how can anyone be \u2018other\u2019 than \u2018themself\u2019? It seems like whatever a person does, by definition, is being themself. \n\nMaybe \u2018be yourself\u2019 means \u2018don\u2019t pretend to be someone you\u2019re not\u2019? Again, this very act of pretending is still \u2018me\u2019 being \u2018myself\u2019.  If I pretend, then I am a pretender, and that\u2019s who I am. \n\nDoes it mean \u2018be your best self?

{"title": "CMV: Podium girls are not a problem", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hfw5o", "selftext": "The subject of Podium girls is quite controversial on cycling subs, good enough to generate all-time top and controversial threads and I would like to know what people think about it.\n\nMy position is simple: When the issue is brought to discussion I always end up concluding that **the** problem is the lack of TV coverage of women's cycling and not the concept of podium girls.\n\nObviously there are some podium girls moments that belong on r/cringe like [this one](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53dd44b5e4b0a4970a8b838e/t/5599bf8ce4b0b41e79752cf8/1436139405145/?format=750w) or [this move of a fan-favorite cyclist some years ago](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53dd44b5e4b0a4970a8b838e/t/5599bb6be4b00d130d5cdf9b/1436138348644/?format=750w), but these are extreme examples which do not represent the majority. \n\nI really like to watch women's cycling and would really be pleased to see more of it on TV (there's like 3 or 4 days of racing a year on Eurosport right now) and the fact that women on the sport are more visible on the podium than on the bike is the problem, IMO. I've seen examples on twitter of happy parents talking about little girls thinking \"ooh I can do that too?\" when La Course was on TV on the last day of Tour de France. And that is an example that there's a lack of coverage (but that's not the issue I want you to discuss).\n\nThen there's the semantics, \"podium girls\" sound quite worse than \"podium women\" which would sound much more reasonable, and I agree with that, let's change the name of it. There's a very recent example of \"podium men\" on a Norwegian race, which sounds a fair way to balance the absence of men on the podiums of women's cycling and apparently would be a reason for people to say we're in a fair position. \n\n**Yet, people think the idea of podium men/women is disgusting and distasteful.\nAnd that's the part I really don't understand and the reason I came to CMV** - maybe because I see podium women since I was a kid? \nThere's the argument of objectifying people, but they are models which are pleased to do their job.\nAlso it's a thing that takes seconds, kisses are a way of congratulate people and how many times have we joked about it and created similar photos with our friends, while having a good time?\n\nSome argue that there's embarrassment between podium girls and the riders, and that may be true, but they're not displeased. [Slightly out of context - this video was spread on the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V70R9hYECW0) and people think it's cute while being a much more embarrassing thing at the start.\nI've seen riders a little more embarrassed when they had to greet politicians.\n\nThe argument against podium women that I agree with is the fact that most of them don't know about cycling. On a recent event on my country, only 2 out of 8 or 10 (I can't recall) had good knowledge about the sport according to a TV report which only had the intent of talking a bit about those girls. Young riders or kids could be there on the podium congratulating the riders and meeting their heroes. Yet, we should consider that podium girls usually represent brands, and they're a way of sponsoring a race and that would need to be rethought if we replaced them.\n\nNote that I'm talking about cycling, on other sports you can see examples that could be easily labeled as sexism, which do not apply to the regular cycling podium, even though I welcome your arguments if you talk about other sports.\n\nAnd well, if you disagree with me, [just don't do this](http://i.imgur.com/LayxpFt.gif), I want to know why you think I'm wrong and I want you to change my view\n____\n\nEdit: last sentence"}

We already have it! It\u2019s the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly.\n\nWe should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute.\n\nSome of the points I have against road transport for individuals.\n\n\n\u2022\tEnvironmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment.\n\n\n\u2022\tSafety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade.\n\n\n\u2022\tStress\u2013 While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers.\n\n\n\u2022\tEnergy efficiency \u2013 A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars.\n\n\n\u2022\tMaintenance \u2013 a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components.\n\n\n\u2022\tEconomy \u2013 Transportation is lot more expensive in cars.\nHere are some points that I have for expansion of public transport.\n\n\n\u2022\tBonus free time \u2013 When I\u2019m in a train I can browse my phone, read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone. This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it.\n\n\n\u2022\tPotty Breaks \u2013 trains can be modified to have them, cars don\u2019t. I\u2019d have to pause my driving, find a gas station and then resume it again, why do that when you can go on the go.\n\n\n\u2022\tFuel Efficiency.\n\n\n\u2022\tNoise reduction.\n\n\n\u2022\tSkill Transfer- People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer.\n\n\nI am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars, I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate. Problems such as energy efficiency, pollution, and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have **today.** \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The best gender-neutral pronouns are 'they,' 'them,' 'their,' etc.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hf5e7", "selftext": "For hundreds of years (I'm assuming), if a writer or speaker was discussing a hypothetical person or a person whose gender they didn't know, they would use the pronouns 'he,' etc. Recently, this is thought of as sexist, since it obviously assumes that whoever the speaker is talking about is male. \n\nAttempts have been made to come up with a gender-neutral pronoun. Each of these has failed, in that they have never caught on with the general populace, so if someone uses them, it causes confusion in the audience. \n\nSometimes you see people write or say \"His or her.\" This just requires extra syllables/ink and usually sounds forced, at least to my ears. Other writers or speakers alternate, using \"he\" and \"him\" for one example, then \"she\" and \"her\" for another. This sometimes works, but often (at least for me) trips up the reader, causing them to reread sections. If nothing else, it usually stands out as a \"I'm trying to not be sexist\" sign. \n\nHowever, in English we already have a perfectly serviceable gender-neutral pronoun: they, and its relatives. In everyday speech, we often say things like, \"Who left their shoes here?\" \"Every student should place their test on the desk,\" or similar things. \n\nI believe they, them, their, etc. are the best gender neutral pronouns. Here's why: \n\n1) Every English speaker understands them without a problem, and uses them fluidly. \n\n2) Any attempt to create a new word will never catch on. New words that catch on usually do so because they describe a new thing that lacks a word, such as 'google,' 'selfie,' etc. Compare those words to Bing's attempts to get people to say use 'bing' as a verb in the same way we use 'google.' \n\n3) Any confusion between the plural use of 'they,' etc. and the gender-neutral, singular use will be minimal, especially since, colloquially, 'they' pretty much already has this meaning. \n\nMy primary view is that we should just embrace 'they' as our gender-neutral pronoun, and use it in daily speech, formal speeches, articles, essays, etc. CMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Voting Day Should be A Public Holiday", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3hf51i", "selftext": "In many democratic countries, the day citizens vote is a public holiday. This is not the case in the US where citizens have to vote before or after work or during a lunch break. I'm from a country where the day people vote is a public holiday. The lines are pretty long in some areas, and the whole process can take a few hours, even if you are quite early. \nSo it makes me wonder, why one earth wouldn't the US not have voting day as a public holiday? It seems like it stops people from voting and that it results in less ballots being cast. This is because people simply do not have the time! People have to juggle a job, family obligations, basic errands needed to survive the day as well as transport and on top of this have to still make time to vote for their futures. It seems counter-intuitive and undemocratic, in the sense that it makes the democratic process less accessible. \n\nAlso, surely the people who won't be able to vote would be from a certain social class or demographic? For example, I\u2019m imagining that a single mother holding down two jobs won\u2019t be able to find the time to do what\u2019s required of her to support herself and her child(ren) in addition to having to find the time to vote. \nIn the case of it being a public holiday, I imagine people will say that this will just be used as a day off to relax and people won\u2019t vote anyway. I think the only people who won\u2019t vote would be people who didn\u2019t want to in the first place for particular reasons, such as cynicism or apathy toward the democratic system, not caring about who\u2019s in charge or no interest in the political system as they don\u2019t think it has an effect on their lives.\n\nI think people will probably also point out that some businesses will likely stay open and citizens will have to work anyway and thus be excluded from voting. In this case, the majority of citizens will still be off work, so this wouldn\u2019t be a complete argument against not having voting day a public holiday. The people who have to work on voting day, would most likely have shorter shifts as this is a public holiday and be allowed to vote. Being that this would be a public holiday, businesses would be forced to pay workers overtime. This would be an incentive to shorter shifts and it would be treated like any other public holiday.\nIn addition, there would be a wider viewership of news networks and other sources of information as citizens would have more time to access this information. \n\nI understand that I come from a different country, so perhaps what I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t going to be particularly applicable to the US. On the other hand, perhaps this is the wake up call that Americans need! In any case, I am greatly interested in discussion and would welcome the chance to change my view.\n\nEdit: Thanks for clearing up a lot of misconceptions I had about the US, which were present in what I wrote. \n\nAside, from picking apart my own argument, I'd greatly appreciate to hear what the arguments are in the US by people who don't want to have citizens take the day off on voting day.\n"}

It's not fundamentally different from God is good, God is great, and the Bible is the word of God. I just happen to come to believe that the former set of axioms is better, and disagree with the latter set of axioms.\n\nIn the debate Ken Ham talks about the difference between observable sciences and unobservable sciences. The former is physics, chemistry, engineering, and in general things we can measure or reproduce.\n\nThe latter includes evolution, Big Bang, and all the other controversial stuff.\n\nI think his argument of why those didn't happen is logical. In fact it's pretty much just Bayesian statistics. We gather evidence and we add those to a prior. We come to the conclusion that is either most likely, requires the fewest assumptions, or some other means of deciding which is \"best\".\n\nEvolutionary biologists have of course constructed a large theory with which the gathered evidence is consistent. Most people, including myself, believe this is the most likely. I however, am not above saying there is a chance it is just completely wrong. Again, unobservables.\n\nFor Ken Ham he includes the Bible in his prior. With the Bible in his prior, the story as told in the Bible of course becomes the most likely, and has the bonus of not requiring any assumptions other than the validity of the Bible as a source. In fact it's the only logical conclusion.\n\nThe only hole I could really find with his argument was the assumption that the Bible was correctly transcribed for two centuries, a series of events he could not have observed. But this is more or less inconsistent with his axioms, and I don't think flies as a counterargument.\n\nThis is motivated in part by a lot of CMVers with the notion that science is inherently superior to religion. I either want to have MV C'd, or open other peoples' minds about taking science &gt; religion as granted.\n\nSo, CMV!\n\nEdit: As clarification, when I say he is intelligent it means that it is highly nontrivial to come up with and shape his arguments the way he does.

My position is that faith based organizations (i.e. religious groups) should not be given any special protection and should follow the same laws as every other organization with respect to discrimination against protected classes.  \n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, I am using the \"[Canadian Human Rights Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/)\" as the thing that defines discrimination. The protected classes from this act are:\n\n1. race\n2. national or ethnic origin\n3. colour\n4. religion\n5. age\n6. sex\n7. sexual orientation\n8. marital status\n9. family status\n10. disability\n11. conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted\n\nMy position is that the right to have freedom of religion does not superseed these rights. If your religion is not able to be tolerant with respect to these rights, then your religion has no place in our tolerant society. These quotations also aptly describe my position:\n\n\u201cTolerance of intolerance is cowardice.\u201d \n\u2015 Ayaan Hirsi Ali\n\n\u201cDon't get so tolerant that you tolerate intolerance.\u201d \n\u2015  Bill Maher\n\n-------------\n\nSome possible criticisms to this position and my response below:\n\n--------------------\n\nQ: But this means that churches would be forced to do Jewish ceremonies!\n\nA: This is not the case. Section 5 of the Human Rights Act states that discrimination occurs when someone is denied a \"provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\" based on the above protected classes. It is only discrimination if the service is generally available but specifically denied to a protected class.\n\n---------------------------\n\nQ: But this means that churches would be forced to hire atheists as priests!\n\nA:  Section 15.1.a of the Human Rights Act already allows for an exemption for positions established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement, which I think would qualify here.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nQ: But this means a bunch of bozos can come in and make a mockery of my church!\n\nA: Being respectful is not a protected class. If someone is not being respectful of your church, it is not discrimination to ask them to leave. \n\n------------------------------\n\nQ: But this means that churches would be forced to perform same sex marriages!\n\nA: Yes, and my position is that if a religious group is not tolerant with respect to sexual orientation, then this religion has no place in our society. I realize that this facet in particular is the most controversial part of my position.\n\n-----------\n\nEDIT: Ok, I have been reminded that in addition to the Human Rights Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establishes freedom of religion. Since it would be impossible to satisfy both freedom of every religion and also my position above, some balancing is necessary. Thus I think any violations of the Human Rights Act would have to be weighed on a case by case basis against the right to their religion. This explains a lot of opposing views on this issue for me: it seems that other people lean more toward the freedom of religion side, whereas I lean more toward the Human Rights side.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad, but no one can give me a logical argument for why.\n\nSo far this is the logic I've heard again and again:\nSelf harm is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could die, or could get an infection.\n\nThe problem I have seen with this is that you can replace \"self harm\" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.\n\nLacrosse is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could get a concussion.\n\nCooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned.\n\nTaking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous.  It is dangerous because it could give you kidney failure.\n\nSo I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous = bad. That means anything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true.\n\nIt is very easy to self harm without any danger.  Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.\n\nOf course this can still leave permanent scars, but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing, so once again, self harm isn't inherently bad just because it leaves scars.  Lots of things leave scars, so scars aren't what's bad about it.\n\nOkay, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem.  Yes.  And the bigger problem is the thing that should be fixed.  But that *still* doesn't mean that the symptom is bad.\n\nIf you have a bacterial infection, you treat the infection.  You don't just cover any redness up with makeup to treat the symptom.  So self harm, the symptom of many mood disorders, isn't what should be treated.\n\nSo besides the ridiculously flawed \"it's dangerous\" argument, explain to me why self harm is inherently bad.\n\nTl;Dr, something being dangerous doesn't make it bad. Give me a real reason why self harm is bad.\n\n**EDIT**  I have to go to bed now, but I will continue this conversation with anyone who posts new comments in the morning.

{"title": "CMV: Property taxes should only depend on the value of the property.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3hct1n", "selftext": "This is fairly straightforward.  I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property.  It should not matter what the use of the property is, or who lives there.  If you own a plot with a value of $300,000, you should pay the same tax as any other owner of a plot valued at $300,000.\n\nThe most egregious example against this to me is [California prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_\\(1978\\)) which freezes property taxes when you buy a house, essentially subsidizing long-term residents at the cost of more recent arrivals.\n\nThe basic reasoning for this is twofold.  First, there's a fairness question, since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are.  In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own. \n\nSecond is an efficiency issue.  Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move (as in prop 13) or to not sell when they don't have good use for the property, such as [this woman who is being sued for failing to maintain a property she can't afford to renovate, but keeps paying the very low taxes on.](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150817/central-harlem/owner-of-dilapidated-landmarked-harlem-home-sued-rare-move-by-city)\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Talking about race, racism, and racial issues along with racial preference programs actually makes any existing problems worse, creates new problems, and divides people rather than unifying them. In my opinion \"not seeing color\" IS the attitude we should cultivate.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3hcpmz", "selftext": "In this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country.\n\nAs I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. \n\nI grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.\n\nI learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as \"Man those specific people suck\" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic.\n\nSo basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. \"Not seeing color\" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems.\n\nI'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why \"not seeing color\" is ridiculed."}
{"title": "CMV: Statistics should be a mandatory part of the high school curriculum, but NOT as a replacement for any standard mathematics courses.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3hceij", "selftext": "Increasingly, many argue that elementary statistics should be a mandatory subject in the high school curriculum.  I agree with this wholeheartedly, as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century.  But to argue, as some have, that this should *replace* the traditional \"algebra to calculus\" high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English.  While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics, they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum, and both are necessary for a complete education.\n\n\nAlthough the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence.  At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation-- you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement.  These are important skills, but they aren't really *mathematical* skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode.  \n\n\nIn a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.  None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum.  \n\n\nYou can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy *does* reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear).  Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace.  Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.\n\n\nAs a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught *well.*  Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa.  I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions.  I have re-thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.  I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math, and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math (akin to physics or computer science) rather than as an optional class within the math department.  But there are alternatives to the algebra-geometry-trig-calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals.\n\n\n**To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.):** thank you also for your participation in the conversation.  Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me.  Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses.  This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course.  As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here.  Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines.\n\n\nThank you again to all who responded.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The default provision of water at restaurants is often wasteful and should be stopped.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3h9mwt", "selftext": "Throughout my lifetime in the southwestern US I have been provided with water at restaurants whether I requested it or not. It's brought out even before drink orders are requested. I drink soda and will leave water completely untouched if it is provided. Often, despite my not requesting it, I've been brought a glass of water along with my glass of soda.\n\nAs many probably know, my area of the country is in a prolonged drought that has led to water rationing, limits on car washing and lawn watering, etc.  We're all advised to limit water usage and waste by turning the tap off while brushing our teeth. We are trying to limit water waste but seem to overlook the waste generated by every diner, whether they will drink it or not, being provided a glass of water, sometimes even an additional carafe on the table. Furthermore, the extra glass that I did not need will now need to be washed, leading to more wasted resources, including more water.\n\nI have been traveling/eating out a lot recently and have been observing many other diners who do not drink the water provided for them because they opt for alcohol or soda.\n\nI certainly think water should be provided for free, but I see no reason that it should be provided preemptively rather than upon request. This practice should be halted in order to reduce water waste.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: Many Parents Have a Lop-Sided Reaction to People Mentioning the Joys of Not Having Children", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3h9ljy", "selftext": "I've noticed this in person, but it is even more apparent on reddit. Almost anywhere on reddit, if there is a comment that gets popular that mentions something good about not having children or something bad about having children it seems there will soon be people replying stuff like \"Geez, apparently all of the child haters are out on reddit today.\" I find this to be an oddly aggressive pushback considering parents often spend a huge amount of time advertising to others exactly how amazing their children are.\n\nTo a certain degree, I think I can understand why this might be. It is kind of like getting a tattoo. Being a parent is something that only goes one direction. Unless you're willing to be practically socially ostracized, then once you have a child there is no going back. So just like getting a tattoo, people suddenly become much more aggressive about defending the practice in the face of even mild disagreement.\n\nThis also reminds me of a similar problem with religious belief. Where people will share their deepest religious convictions in public and make definitive statements about how the universe works and then respond with an out-sized reaction when someone posts something about how they don't really think any of that makes much sense."}
{"title": "CMV: Building a PC isn't worth the effort/headache", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3h9gcv", "selftext": "I don't think building a PC is worth it unless you enjoy the process of doing so. The $100-200 you save isn't worth the work it takes to assemble the thing and troubleshoot faulty parts.\n\nSo I had a 100% functional pc I built years ago, and decided I'd \"rebuild\" it with a skylake CPU/new motherboard/new cooler/ddr4 RAM.\n\nI was short on cash, so I decided to reuse the same GPU for now, 100% functional before I built the new PC.\n\nPackage arrives, I take a couple hours to assemble it as the cooler is a bit tricky. But I get it right, but the system only outputs to the onboard VGA. Onboard DVI and GPU outputs don't work, but the GPU fans are spinning. Yes, the PCIe power connectors are connected, and yes I properly seated the GPU.\n\nSo I look online, and people tell me I probably just need drivers. So I install windows just fine. Try to get drivers off of AMD's site, install fails. Not surprising, because the GPU won't show in the device manager. Great.\n\nSo I turn it off, open it up, and put a spare GPU into the same slot. Still no image. I then take that spare GPU, and put it in the 2nd PCIe slot. Magically, it works. But this PCIe slot operates at x8, and isn't big enough to fit high end GPUs because the SATA ports are in the way. So no bueno.\n\nI decide that the PCIe slot is broken, and take the pc apart to get the board ready to RMA. I decide I need a PC while I wait for the new parts, so I reassemble my old build, which took even more time.\n\nSystem boots, image displayed but now the video card fans don't spin. System restarts after a few minutes abruptly. Obviously, this means that the card is overheating due to no active cooling.\n\nPut in spare card, works fine. So the new motherboard I bought fried the video card I own due to a falty PCIe slot, and chances are Newegg or ASUS won't cover that, judging by what I read online.\nSo now I'm down $600 I spent on new parts, 2 days worth of time I spent troubleshooting(which I could have made a lot if I worked those days), and now I'm stuck using a low end GPU as the motherboard fried my $200 one.\n\nThere's a reason that professional corporations just buy OEM PCs like Dell instead of hiring people to build them. The build process is all fine if you know what you're doing and all parts work, but the moment you get 1 DOA part that fries other parts, then it's pure hell to figure out what to replace, and what to keep. The time spent troubleshooting poor parts isn't worth the miniscule amount of money you save.\n\nI've been working in a PC repair shop for a year, took a year long pc repair course, and I'm comptia A+ certified, so I know what I'm doing, for the most part. But imagine if this happened to a beginner, who is just going off of guides found online with no experience behind them in troubleshooting. They would have no clue what part to blame, what to RMA, what to buy. \n\nUnless you're extremely frugal, or enjoy building PCs, you're better off just buying an OEM PC. The $100-200 yous ave isn't worth the time spent figuring it out, or the risk that you'll never get it to work at all(because of DOA parts or rookie mistakes)"}

{"title": "CMV: Dr. Seuss should be required High School literature before \"classics\" such as Steinbeck, Dickens, and even Shakespeare", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3h8slk", "selftext": "My reasoning behind this is, for the most part the above authors lack lessons. While they don't all always, the biggest thing teachers enjoy is pointing out the themes behind each book. Why do themes matter? Why should students learn about literature in the past when we learn about the past from History?\n\nDr. Seuss's books contain lessons. Being yourself, being creative, not being an asshole, caring about the planet, etc.\n\nI'm not picking out those authors exclusively, they're just some examples I thought of since I've read some of their works and I was disappointed (I guess you could say I had Great Expectations) because I'm in school to learn, and most of these books are rather dull and don't teach me anything besides themes that parallel from human nature back then to now. It's annoying reading Of Mice and Men and seeing all of these themes about friendship and loyalty in the great depression and not coming out a better person after reading it. You could stretch for several lessons but they're mostly reiterations of the themes. \n\nSo I feel like the school system is failing me by dulling me down with pointless \"theme-based\" literature rather than literature with lessons and morals that could prepare us for the world we're gonna face. Not just themes in the world we can relate to, but how to not be a dick or how to plant a tree or stay creative while aging seem pretty important. \n\nSo in order to not completely hate the school system and rant at my teacher and probably not do any homework based on the theme-based literature, CMV.\n\n*For clarification, USA high schools. Not sure how other countries do their classes but our English classes have mandatory books read throughout the country.

This would have no effect on small businesses, of course, but would have a major positive impact on major corporations like, for instance, wal-mart. According to [this](http://www1.salary.com/Wal-Mart-Stores-Inc-Executive-Salaries.html) site, wal-mart paid it's top 6 execs just over $50 million combined. So, with a $5 mil wage cap wal-mart would have over $20 mil in surplus cash which it would then, logically, invest into more warehouses, factories and stores, creating more jobs. \n\nWalmart wouldn't be the only company doing this, though, most of the biggest companies would be doing the same with their sudden surpluses which would lead to a labor shortage which would drive up salaries and benefits for the average workers. More people making more money leads to more business for all companies and more tax revenue for cash-strapped local, state, and federal governments. Everyone wins.\n\nBonus: The super wealthy will no long be willing to make such huge political contributions. Who would drop $50 mil on a candidate, who might not even win, if it'll take them a decade to earn that money back?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: it is normal for adults to be attracted to people who are in their late teens.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3h8ell", "selftext": "I did not know this was an unpopular opinion until recently. Basically my stance is as follows.\n\nPeople in their late teens are fully physically developed and have all the qualities that other adults find sexually appealing. They are sexual beings both physically and mentally. So it is evident to me that the Natural Order of Things supports my view.\n\nFeel free to correct me if I am wrong but, for all of human history up until recently people regularly married people in their late teens and they were seen as adults. I think the change in perception can be attributed to three things:\n\n1. People now marry later in life, the norm in this culture is to sleep around when they are younger. Adding on to that...\n\n2. We have a hookup culture. In the past people may have been more serious about relationships (feel free to correct me if I am wrong) but nowadays a lot of people just hook up and marry when they want to \"settle down\" later in life. As a result people more readily assume that anyone interested in a younger person is up to no good and isn't serious. Which is probably the source of aversion to this kind of attraction; because they want to protect them.\n\n3. People nowadays do not consider people in their late teens to be adults while in the past they were. I think this could be a result of how present society coddles people even through their college years whereas many later-year teens have the potential to be a functional adult with a job, spouse and kids if raised differently. Probably a result of people getting married later in life which is a result of promiscuity due to culture and availability of contraception.\n\nFurthermore I would actually assert that forbidding relationships based on age, given that both are ready physically and mentally for that kind of relationship, is immoral; because you are stepping in the way of love, no one is getting hurt (besides pain of breakup if that happens), etc.\n\nSo basically the only thing I see that supports the argument against my view is that culture opposes it. While culture and soceity's rules may be influenced by truth, they are arbitrary. Society's rules are nothing in the face of objective truth (refer to my statement about the Natural Order of Things above) If they are not molded after it already. Adding on to this, I've heard (again, feel free to correct me if I am wrong) that women's brains become fully mature at ~17 and men's brains become fully mature at ~23. Its why in the past, men were legally considered minors at a later age than women were. If you make the argument that someone cannot rightfully enter a relationship with an adult until their brain is fully mature, you would be forced to also agree that ~17 y/o women should be available and that men should not be available until ~23. My own solution to this is that maturity in decision making is not wholly dependent on this one variable. Many adults don't make very \"adult\" decisions and many teens make responsible, \"adult\" decisions. This is, instead, something to assess regarding the individual, which applies to people 20+ as well.\n\nAlso I do not believe that such relationships hurt anyone by default. One person may be more inexperienced but that is a vulnerability that the other person does not have to exploit if they are a decent human being after the right thing.\n\nA bit of context: I'm a 21 y/o college student and do find myself attracted to people in their late teens, as well as adults. I feel that this is normal and natual and not a fetish or somehing that is uncommon. I do not get off on domination or whatever like some people think those who have this attraction do. I just find that my brain recognizes those people as fellow adults. I'm also not looking to hook up, I'm a actually abstaining from sex until marriage and take all my relationships seriously; no \"spring flings\" or whatever for me.\n\nMy grandparents met and started dating when grandma was 16 and grandpa was 21. They were and are both very happy and have a good marriage. Imagine if they had dismissed each other as unavailable or were prevented from being together. (Refer to how I said that this kind of prevention is immoral).\n\nELI5 TLDR: People in their late teens many times cannot be differentiated from other \"adults\" if you did not know their age. So it is normal to be attracted to them and the current taboo is only a recent, arbitrary social rule based on nothing more than culture. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Raising minimum wage directly incentivizes automation. These jobs are already the most vulnerable to automation (I'm thinking about jobs like cashiers). The more expensive it is to pay an employee, the more likely it is that employers will look for ways to automate those jobs. EITC avoids this because it won't the employers who directly front the costs of increasing revenue for those within a certain income bracket.\n\n2. Not everyone deserves a $15 per hour wage. To be clear, I am fully on board with the the idea that somebody who is supporting themselves and working 40 hours per week should be able to make a living wage. For those who are in that situation, I think EITC should compensate whatever wages they make such that their yearly salary is sufficient. However, there are also 15 year olds who just want a summer job, and definitely aren't supporting themselves. By excluding those who aren't supporting themselves (I think the criteria is that you're under 26 and provide less than half of the money needed to support yourself), we avoid paying people excessive salaries when they don't really need to be paid that much."}

Many people have really strong opinions against smoking in public, because it is upsetting them and accordingly laws have been past in many countries that limit/prohibit smoking in public transport, public buildings, etc. However, it is not uncommon to be leg-humped by a dog in the bus, or step into dog-poo in the park, which I find really annoying. This seems to be regarded as unproblematic, some pepole even get annoyed if you do not want to touch their animal companion with questionable hygiene standards.* You may say that (contrary to smoking) these are merely inconveniences, but in fact...\n* ...Some dogs are plain dangerous. Have a look at the [\"Fatal dog attacks\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) wiki entry. Granted, there are MUCH more people dying from cars, cigaretts, cancer (and that's only deadly stuff with a C), etc. but in my opinion even one person would be too much. There are a lot of young children on the list as well. \n* My rant so far may have given you the opinion that I just hate animals. However, the opposite is true - I love them! Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day. \n* They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. \n* Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them!

If you bring a child into this world, it is pretty much a given that it will suffer in some way - and many times, this suffering can be catastrophic. Put simply, there is no way to justify this suffering when it can be so easily avoided by simply not having babies.\n\nBy \"suffering\" I mean anything and everything - from something as simple as a cold, to anxiety about money, suffering from severe illness, becoming homeless, stress and any number of other things that can cause suffering in a person's life.\n\nBringing a child into this world makes you responsible for all the suffering throughout a child's life - had you not taken the decision to have a child, the child would not have suffered, because he would not exist.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that the \"default position\" for humanity is suffering. By this I mean that if you do *absolutely nothing*, you will suffer. You have to exert a great deal of effort not to suffer - you need to constantly provide yourself with food, shelter and protection - if you don't you will starve, get cold, etc. This means that by bringing a child into the world, you are forcing them to exert effort to prevent themselves from suffering.\n\nThis may be justifiable if we were given the option to \"opt out\", but we are not. People will do *everything in their power* to prevent people from opting-out (and by this I mean taking one's own life). Examples: even on a forum as open as Reddit, we are still forbidden to discuss opting out. Anyone who has taken the decision to opt out and wants to find out how to do so quickly and painlessly will find themselves unable to do so. Medicines that give this option are strictly controlled, with harsh penalties for breaking the laws. Jumping spots are patrolled or fenced off. Anyone attempting to discuss opting out openly risks being detained in a medical institution against their will and possibly even forcibly medicated.\n\nA common response to this argument is, \"Look at all the joy and beauty that can be experienced in life\". My counter-response is that such joy is not a given, as suffering is. Additionally, if one wishes to experience many of the good things in life, they have to exert *even more* effort than they do simply to hold off their suffering. The probability of experiencing suffering, and the amount of suffering likely to be experienced is also greater than that of the probability of experiencing joy, given that suffering is the \"default state\".\n\nAnother argument against that is that anyone deciding *not* to have children simply cannot be held responsible for depriving a person of joy - since such a person does not exist.\n\nThere is also no good reason to bring children into this world in despite of suffering. The future of humanity is often bought up, but none of us have any reasonable interest in the future of mankind since none of us will be alive to experience it. It's a moot point. Nobody will suffer if humanity comes to an end due to people not having babies.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

National, our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote, nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader, but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us. We all agreed at the time that if there was a vote that had no significance in the election other than to measure those people who do not believe we have any valid current person running for prime minister we would not only have a higher turnout at the election with little effort, but we'd also have a better idea of what the general perception was on the stability of the political scene. This would help us to build a better political scene long term and involve the voter, ultimately resulting in higher voting turnout at a fraction of the cost or social effort and would result in a better turnout. This would theoretically apply globally too, as in countries such as the US it could be used to show many things, not just the (lack of) confidence in either leader, but also other things.

Many college graduates have a huge amount of student debt, and many students dropout because of financial problems. \n\n2) I'm not smart. I'm a senior in high school. Actually a senior with junior credits. I'm missing 1.5 credits. 1.0 for math and 0.5 for Biology. I see college is for people who are lucky, smart, or rich. Most smart kids from my school were given scholarships because well... they were smart. The lucky few are people who are in sports and sometimes people like that little kid who went to McDonald's for some light to do his homework. And for the rich kids, obviously they have the money to get in there. From what I heard from other people, college won't take you if you're SATS aren't great or your GPA isn't up to par. I was really discouraged about that. Me unable to attend college because I'm not good at one subject. \n\n3) A huge waste of time. Many jobs requires a minimum of a high school diploma. As I start researching the jobs that I wanted, I started to slowly realize that most of the job I need requires a college degree. I really wanted to take Filmmaking, but I heard rumors about why taking it isn't worth it. But that's a whole different story. And another one is, I wanted to be a cop. I heard from other people that in order to be a cop, you need a college degree. And as stated in reason 2, I don't think I'm able to go to college to be a cop or a filmmaker because I'm broke and \"not smart\". \n\nI'm joining the Air Force, and I know the military can help you with education student loans and all that, but once I start thinking about it, it goes straight to reason 2. I'm plain out stupid. No matter how much time I spend studying math or being tutored, I can never get it. Math isn't for me. \n\nMoney and math is the only thing that is stopping me going to college."}

This perception is incorrect but is still commonplace. I believe that the Bush years will be viewed similarly by future generations for the following reasons:\n\nThe much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.\n\nBush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.\n\nClimate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.\n\nImperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.\n\nEconomic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been [reversed](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/timworstall/files/2015/01/oxfam1.jpg) by this fucking crisis. Global equity markets are now [as US-centric](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12) as they've ever been since at least the Eighties, meaning that \"the rise of the rest\" has been an utter illusion.\n\nErosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony \"development\" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.\n\nTL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W. Bush will be (rightfully or not) blamed.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV:The popular reaction toward the Cecil lion incident was emotional and hypocritical", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3gxzsf", "selftext": "First, I make the assumption that there is a very large intersection between people complaining about Cecil the lion's death, and people who eat meat.  Given the prevalence of meat consumption in the U.S., and the popularity of the outrage toward the incident, I think this is a reasonable assumption.  Keeping that in mind, here are my arguments, in order of importance.  \n\n**1)** Cecil was 13 years old.  Males rarely even live to this age in the wild, so it was very likely that he would have soon been killed by another lion, had he been left alone.  Therefore, the damage done to the species is negligible.  \n\n**2)** Meat production necessitates production of methane, which is [**25 times more more potent**](http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html) than CO2 at warming the earth.  Beef and lamb (and other ruminants) are **very** high producers of methane, and animal agriculture is responsible for 26% of methane emissions in the U.S.  \n\nRuminant meat production (beef, lamb, bison, goat, etc.) also emits [an extremely large amount of CO2](http://www.theecologist.org/siteimage/scale/0/0/286401.jpg), which is the most familiar greenhouse gas in popular discourse.  Even pork and chicken emit 6 and 3 times, respectively, as much CO2 as vegetarian protein options.  \n\nMeat is unnecessary for a healthy diet, and there's a lot of evidence that cutting out red meat (the meats which make up the lion's share, pun intended, of greenhouse gas emissions) is actually beneficial to human health.  There's also growing evidence that methionine restriction is beneficial to humans.  All animal proteins from mammals and birds are high in methionine, plant proteins are low in it.  \n\nBy eating meat on a regular basis, particularly red meat, one directly exacerbates global warming, which would not only severely threaten the lion population, but also most complex life on earth.  \n\n**3)** Meat production also takes up far more space per calorie and per unit protein than plant production.  This means that native wild fauna are prevented from returning to their natural habitat, and if demand for meat rises, that they are also further pushed out of any remaining habitat they have.  \n\n**4)** The dentist who shot the lion paid $50,000 to have that privilege.  The GDP per head in Zimbabwe is about $950, so his actions put 50 people's annual salaries into the country.  \n\n**In summary:**  The lion was old, and had little value to the species.  Eating meat severely endangers all life on earth.  Eating meat also means further destruction of wild animals' habitats for pasture land.  The dentist also brought a large sum of money into the local economy in order to shoot the lion.  \n\nTherefore, anyone who is morally outraged about Cecil the lion's death and also eats meat regularly, particularly beef/lamb, is a hypocrite.  Thus, the majority of the outrage comes from a place of emotion (discrimination), and is not morally justified.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: i believe that Christian conservatives who oppose gay marriage are inconsistent in their desired application of the bible to law and politics", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3gxgf8", "selftext": "I understand that the bible is pretty explicitly against gay marriage and behavior, and I get why religious conservatives might think to use the bible as justification to ban actions,  behaviors, institutions, etc. that would not be banned on the basis of rational, secular reasoning alone (e.g. gay marriage, which does not seem to have any valid secular reasons to ban). \n\n\nHowever, the bible is also explicitly against many things that I do not believe most religious conservatives want to ban. Most significantly, the [*very first commandment*](http://lifehopeandtruth.com/bible/10-commandments/the-ten-commandments/10-commandments-list/) states in no uncertain terms that it is against God's desires for God's people to have other gods. You might argue that this applies only to the Jews and descendants of those Jews who were saved from Egypt. But there are several [other verses](http://www.openbible.info/topics/false_gods) that forbid people from having other gods. Yet I don't see Christian conservatives rallying up, calling for the repeal of the 1st Amendment, and demanding a ban on Hinduism and other Polytheistic religons. Shouldn't \"literally worshipping false gods\" be *just as if not more* apalling to Christian conservatives as \"Two men who love each other getting a marriage license\"? Shouldn't there be just as much of an outcry from socially conservative Christians against the 1st Amendment's freedom of religion clause (which allows Hindus and others to worship \"false\" gods) as there is against legalized gay marriage? It seems to me to be a very inconsistent view of the bible's tenets in forming political opinions.\n\n(Resubmitted as the previous post had a typo in the title)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Video games built around addiction by investment are immoral.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3gxey2", "selftext": "I believe that video games that are designed from the ground up to retain players by constantly reminding them of the time they've already invested in the game are immoral, regardless of the actual quality of the game otherwise. For my argument, I have three major examples: World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Clash of Clans. These may not be the worst offenders or even the best examples, but they are the ones that I have the most personal experience with and thus feel like I am most able to discuss.\n\nWorld of Warcraft has often received flak for its addictive properties by way of grinding. The player is led into a repetitive cycle of doing the same or similar things over and over again to slowly improve their character or extensions of their character. This is often cited as the core reason that World of Warcraft and other MMO's are so addictive, but I believe that another reason that often goes unnoticed is how attached players get to their investment of time. Players who may not gain much actual enjoyment out of the game anymore continue to play because they feel that if they stop playing that the countless hours that they've sunk into the game have been for nothing. This is doubly emphasized by the monthly subscription fee, where players considering quitting the game will consider not just the time they've invested, but also the money. The longer they've played, the more money they've \"wasted\" if they stop.\n\nLeague of Legends follows very similar principles. Even if the core game itself is well-designed and fun in its own right, the fact that the game is still built around an investment damns it all the same. Players who get hooked on the gameplay will accumulate points that they can use to unlock new characters and different gameplay-adjusting tools. Eventually they will probably spend money on the game to either unlock and new character faster or to purchase a cosmetic skin for a character that they particularly enjoy. So now they've been put in the same situation. Even if they start to get bored with the game, many people will continue to play because of how much time and usually money that they've invested into the game. If they quit, it's not just the knowledge and skills they've developed that are going to waste, but also all the time and money they've devoted to unlocking things within the game.\n\nAnd of course if you've followed this far, you probably know where I'm going with Clash of Clans. Mobile games in general seem to have taken this principle to an extreme. In Clash of Clans not only are you constantly trying to improve your base and troops, but you are constantly seeing other people's bases which motivates the player in two different ways: one by showing them better bases, which they envy, and two by showing them worse bases, to remind them of how far they've come. And there the same principle comes to play. Players don't want to stop playing because they are constantly reminded of how much time (and, again, possibly money) that they've already invested and they don't want to \"waste\" it by quitting.\n\nWhy I think this is immoral should be, I hope, obvious. Players who no longer enjoy a game are psychologically manipulated into continuing to play, and the longer they play, the harder it is for them to stop. But what makes it even worse is the social aspect of it. All the aforementioned game are also very social games where players are encouraged to \"show off\" what they've earned or bought. This gives positive feedback on their investment and makes the addiction that much stronger. And as I touched on with the Clash of Clans paragraph, this effect hits twice as players with less who are shown off to are likely to be envious and be motivated to be trapped in the same investment addiction that the show offs are trapped in. Of course, much of that is human nature, but that makes taking advantage of it, especially in such refined and systematic ways, no less immoral.\n\nPlease challenge my view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Many of them have held high government positions (governors, senators) or high-ranking business positions (CEO's). They would know what to do as a President.\n\nAll of the important gov't positions are filled with appointed candidates (The Cabinet, Joint Chiefs, Fed Chairman, SC Justices and etc), who are typically chosen based on their actual abilities and not on their likability to the masses.\n\nFor example, say something happens to Obama and he can no longer be a president. Would anything drastic happen in the gov't? Not really, Biden would become president and business would go on as usual.\n\nThus whether it's the populist Sanders, the clown Trump, the crazy Cruz, the young Rubio, the old lady Clinton or the libertarian Paul, nothing spectacular or drastic would come.

Because of this humans and animals are equal and should be treated the same. Humans don't have to eat meat.

Just because I feel more of a \"connection\" to humans because they're the same kind of animal as I am doesn't mean that it's right to kill those that I don't feel a connection with, because as I said, they are able to feel suffering, and that's what counts.\n\nBeing pro-murder of living beings being able to feel pain is basically on the bottom of the moral list. Murder is the worst thing anyone can do to another living being. My moral is already so bad, who am I to say people can't be racist? Who am I to say people can't rape? I am pro-murder for gods sake, these things aren't as bad as murder.

{"title": "CMV: Only cisgender exists", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3gs0zf", "selftext": "I'd like to start this by clearly defining my position:\n\nI think only cisgender, and by that I mean identifying with the gender you are born with, is a valid gender identification. I don't know if valid is the right world but it's the only one that sounds appropriate. Essentially, I think gender and biological sex are one and the same, gender is just a social construct to express our biological sex.\n\n\nIn every animal in nature we can find two sexes, male and female. Sometimes the sexes have similar roles, sometimes the male or the female has more important roles, it doesn't matter - It's there, and it's happening in nature. I'm not making an appeal to nature as a form of fallacy, I'm merely pointing out that it's a special pleading fallacy to think humans are special because we can get away with ignoring our biological sex. I admit that Humans have less sexual dimorphism than other animals and namely we can find, aside from physical and procreation capacities, little differences between men and women because both are capable of amazing things. I'm ok with abolishing or ignoring gender roles and allowing boys and girls to play with what they want. What we can't do is to pretend that we can magically change the sex we are born into.\n\nTo use an analogy, if I decided to transplant my nose and put some whiskers and called myself a tiger, would I be a tiger or just a nutjob? What would you consider me?\n\nThe primary argument for transgenderism is that gender dysphoria makes people feel bad about the biological sex they are born with or the gender they were assigned at birth, and therefore they have the right to identify with what makes them more comfortable. This sounds nice and reasonable, but the issue is that thinking we are something does not make us that something. I can imagine I'm a dragon in my head but that doesn't change the fact dragons don't exist and I'm still Human.\n\nTo categorize and simplify arguments:\n\n1 - Every or most species have a male and female specimen and, regardless of what roles each one has, to think Humans are different is a special pleading, kinda like thinking Humans will forever be the best species on the universe\n\n2 - The fact someone's brain tells them something is wrong or better doesn't mean it's true. If your brain can identify as a genderqueer or genderneutral, I don't see how I can't identify as a rock or a dragon. Why is the latter less valid? The fact the brain identifies as such doesn't mean we are such, it's irrelevant. If you are born with a penis, you are a man and if you are born with a vagina, you are a woman. There are obvious biological features specially related to procreation and body shape. Some transgender people, even those who have surgery, will forever look similar to the gender they don't want to be associated it, it's inevitable. The fact I want to change my deepest self doesn't mean I am actually doing it.\n\n3 - Why is gender special? In short, why can't I magically change other things about myself? I look white, and I know race is a social construct - It's still a useful concept to categorize us - Why can't I identify as black even with pale skin? Why can't a redhead identify as a black hair? Why can't children identify as adults, etc.? Again, special pleading.\n\n\nOh, I also think the word cisgender shouldn't even be used.\n\nSome notes:\n- I am not promoting violence and hate against transgender people. If I meet someone who is trans, I will treat them like I treat anyone else. I can disagree with the core idea without hating the person.\n- Don't bring up analogies to gay people and gay marriage because both are incomparable and completely different topics.\n- Don't use \"you're a bigot\" as an argument\n- My arguments have nothing to do with religion, I'm an atheist."}
{"title": "CMV: Prostitution should be legalized, I don't feel most arguments against it hold water.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3gri3k", "selftext": "I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (\"It's the oldest profession\"; \"we should have full rights to our bodies\") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**\n\nOne of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that \"Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options\".\n\nI fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?\n\nIf I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because \"Desperate people might feel obligated to work them\", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.\n\nI think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:\n\n&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.\n\n&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.\n\n&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.\n\n&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (\"Massage parlors\"). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.\n\n(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).\n\n**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**\n\n-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.\n\n-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.\n\n-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.\n\n**What I would not like to see:**\n\n-Outright moral arguments (\"Selling your body is wrong\", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)\n\n-Any arguments I listed above without additions (\"Women will be forced into sex slavery\")\n\n-Religious arguments\n\nThanks for your time :3\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all \"whites\" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the \"white vs black\" dichotomy. \n\nMy opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it \"you\" vs \"partner\", you have to make it \"both of you as a couple\" vs \"the problem\". So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us.\n\nPerhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion.\n\nEdit: Sorry if I reply late, having a bit of a family emergency. "}

I'm just asking that you remain civil. As much as I try I just can't understand the other side of this argument.\n\nBasically, I believe that rape is not a big problem on college campuses, the real problem is that no one agrees as to what consent is anymore. What sparked this was the recent news story:\n\nhttp://www.thecollegefix.com/post/23709/\n\nIn this story, the woman has sex with the man, then sees him kissing another woman and decides that she was raped. It is mentioned that the woman attended a lecture where the speaker (a college administrator) said that regretting a sexual encounter means that you were raped. I think that this is a horrible definition of rape and it hurts both men and women.\n\nThen there is the mattress girl story and the Duke lacrosse story and the Rolling Stone story, all of which were big name rape cases, all of which turned out to be false accusations.\n\nWhy does this keep happening? I believe that a large part of it is that people are operating under sexist definitions of consent and rape.\n\nIf a man and woman both get drunk and have sex, the woman can claim rape and it's all the guys fault.\n\nIf a man and woman have sex and the woman later regrets it, the woman can claim rape and it's all the guys fault.\n\nIf a man and woman have sex and the woman later is angry and wants to get revenge, the woman can claim rape and it's all the guys fault.\n\nNone of these situations are rape, but nonetheless, men have been punished for these exact situations.\n\nIn short, I believe that women are now taught to believe that if they have any regret about a sexual encounter, then it is rape. Other women have come to see that false rape claims are a powerful weapon. These cases inflate the college rape statistics. It is impossible for a man to have a one-night stand anymore without fear of being dragged through the mud and having his life ruined.\n\nEDIT: I don't appreciate the mass downvotes on all of my comments.

{"title": "CMV: College Tuition should not be completely government subsidized", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3gq2wl", "selftext": "So, I'm writing this as an American, and one of the big crux points of Bernie Sander's policy is fully subsidizing college with government funds. I really think that's a bad for a few reasons.\n\n1. There are a ton of jobs that already require college degrees that frankly probably shouldn't. You don't even need a degree in the same field as what you're doing sometimes, they just want 'a degree.' This would instead put the burden of a nearly useless degree on the community, instead of the individual. Why should I be helping pay for someone who majored in one thing only to go work somewhere completely different?\n\n2. There are already government subsidized educations, such as federal service academies, ROTC programs, some doctors/lawyers that get picked up by the military, among other programs. They get their education paid for in return for service to the government. This makes sense to me, the government is getting people who are educated in a specific way that they need in return for paying for their education. You couldn't feasibly employ this type of program over the whole country because some people want to take degrees in something the government has no use for. \n\n3. This is essentially making college degrees completely necessary. It would be nearly free, or so cheap that almost everyone can afford it, even though some people are not going to be able to hack it. College is not for everyone, it's meant to push your boundaries and really develop critical thinking skills. What do you do for the people who are not capable of receiving a college degree? What if they go, and flunk out? Does the government still foot that bill? That would be a waste of money. Would they be forced to pay it back? That's penalizing someone who already is going to have a tough time making money. \n\nI am in favor of fixing how the system works. People who get a degree, and are successful (which isn't everyone) still have years and years of huge debts to pay off. We need to figure out a way to cap those debts off, make it more affordable. Not every college degree makes a ton of money, particularly some professions where a college degree is very necessary, so we need to work on that. I just really don't think a full subsidy is the wrong move. \n\nEdit: Hey everyone I really appreciate the arguments. Some stuff has come up and I haven't had time to read through all of them yet. I'll be reading through them once my time gets a little more freed up."}
{"title": "CMV: Any life other than one of poverty is unethical.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3gpqk4", "selftext": "Lets start by looking at a situation:\n\nImagine you are walking by a shallow river on your way to a ball when you see a child drowning. You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child? \n\nLet's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child? \n\nNow lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but i couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha.\n\nI will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds.\n\nBut,  I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river:\n\nConsequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism):\nYou would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasure/happiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that.\n\nDeontological ethics (i.e. Kant):\nI only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag.\n\nI've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but i didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.\n\nThanks for your answers!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today.

I know for a fact, that these ideas are a reaction to claims from so-called \"SJW's\" that they are some newfangled stargender, or a magigirl, or identities that seem to be, and that in many many cases actually are a call for attention or an attempted claim to oppression.\n\nMy view is that this reaction is not really representative of reality, and erases people who are most definitely LGBT+, today and in history. I recently came to this conclusion, and it does seem a bit flimsy still, so I'm really interested in hearing the counterarguments so I can either edit my view to something more fitting, learn from the counterarguments, or drop it altogether.\n\nHere are the reasons that i believe this:\n\n* Transvestites, people who liked to wear women's clothes and used female pronouns, but didn't mind being recognized as male when not in drag or crossdressing. Marsha P Johnson was known to be fine with male pronouns from close friends, and never sought to transition, to call her cis would still be inaccurate.\n\n* My own experience. I know anecdotes are not evidence, but I'm explaining why I hold this view. I dunno why I've been obsessed with dresses and gowns since childhood. I came out as gay a year or so ago ad recently discovered drag, and nothing has ever felt so right, the idea of presenting as a woman while having that sort of dual gender feels like it describes me perfectly. I'm still hesitant to call myself genderqueer or genderfluid but I'm also not sure that it's accurate to call myself a guy.\n\n*  The fact that not wanting to chop one's weiner or boobs off implies that one's identity is set in stone and saying anything else is calling for attention in the transmedicalist view. I don't think you can talk about human psychology in such rigid terms.\n\n**This View is NOT**\n\n* That all non cis identities are valid. I'm not gonna defend stargender or magigirl/boy, mostly because I think those either don't exist or in the case of the latter are so close to a gender (it's literally the definition) that they might as well be binary.\n\n* That being trans non-cis is a choice. I still think that this internal sense of how we identify is ruled by things like brain chemistry or exposure to certain hormones while in the womb (as shown by digit ratio)\n\n* That womanhood and manhood are limited to things like clothing, makeup , and roles and stereotypes. A key thing I mentioned is that people above all want to be recognized and treated like a certain gender (through gendered words and pronouns and whatnot) and often their presentation reflects that, rather than interest int he objects of the presentation by themselves.\n\n**Things that would CMV**\n\n* If I have a fundamental misunderstanding of the point of transmedicalism, or the definition of dysphoria that they use\n\n* If I have a fundamental misunderstanding of gender and what it means\n\n* If my feelings and those of others are better explained by things unrelated to gender identity or being non cisgender\n\n* If not being transmedicalist can harm trans people who suffer from dysphoria.\n\n* And of course other things I don't know yet, but these are I think the pillars of my view.\n  \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Free Trade only benefits big business, and is detrimental to developed and developing countries.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3glrc6", "selftext": "There has been a lot of talk lately about how free trade is great for the economy in Canada, but the principles can likely be applied to other developed countries. The general idea is that Canada buys mass produced stuff from developing countries because they can make it cheaper there than we can back home. In return we sell some Blackberries, tar sand oil, maple syrup, and apologies.\n\nBig business wins. They get to make their widgets at the lowest cost possible while maximizing their profit. Other than a few \"we give back\" marketing campaigns that try to suggest that corporations have souls, as long as the dollars keep rolling in, they don't care.\n\nDeveloped countries lose. Our politicians talk about a declining/shrinking middle class, when they are signing free trade agreements that further incentivize off-shoring middle class jobs. They lament the lack of manufacturing jobs while we make it easier for companies to bring in cheaper stuff from other countries. \n\nQuality also suffers. In countries that take pride in home grown manufacturing (looking at you America) typically you pay more for the made at home product, but it is often made to a higher standard. I would pay more for something made in Canada, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so. \n\nDeveloped countries \"win\" because they can buy a bunch of cheap junk with planned obsolescence so we keep buying more, which perpetuates the cycle. \n\nDeveloping countries lose. The Rana Plaza collapse, and the suicide nets for jumpers are two big things that come to mind, but plenty more issues exist as well. Working conditions are extremely dangerous, the workers are often exposed to hazardous chemicals without proper protection, and many of those chemicals are not disposed of correctly which has a huge environmental impact. The money generated by manufacturing typically goes into the hands of very few, and the majority of it goes to the corporations that don't pay taxes on it anyway. Instead of producing goods and services that could go back into their own economy, they are exporting everything and just providing cheap and unethical labour. \n\nFree Trade is bad. Instead of providing incentives for off-shoring, we should be providing incentives to keep work at home. Canadian manufacturers (and those in other developed countries) could compete and beat international prices if taxes and tariffs were in place to level the playing field. All of the factory workers who are out of work would have much better prospects than minimum wage service jobs, which would lead to a thriving middle class that would be great for our economy, and we could keep some of that corporate profit (and tax) in Canada, because we wouldn't be buying from all over the world. We already protect dairy and poultry farming to keep those jobs and products in country, why not everything else?\n\nFor those of you that made it this far, I understand that there are a few things that would be particularly difficult to produce or manufacture in Canada. Produce we don't have the climate for, or natural resources we don't have an abundance of come to mind, but the vast majority of what we consume from other countries could be made at home.  \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, the statement is problematic because it assumes that if you do not cut down the sycamore tree, then you could eventually know how high a sycamore tree can grow. If this assumption is not made, then there is really know point to the statement in the context of the song because all it is saying now is that whatever you do you can never know how high the sycamore tree can grow. If whatever you do relating to the sycamore tree is futile, then not cutting it down doesn't serve the purpose she is proposing.\n\nIf you can know the height that the sycamore tree can grow if you don't cut it down, then at that point you can cut it down and still know how high it can grow. Thus, the assumptions that Pocahontas puts forth are self-contradictory and at least one must be incorrect.\n\nTo change my view, you must either prove that Pocahontas is not making the assumptions that I say she is making or that these premises are not inherently contradictory.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm sort of a mixed bag; there are some liberal things I agree with (Raising taxes on the rich, welfare, increased minimum wage, equal pay rates on both men and women [although this has been a hot topic on whether it's true or not, because where I work both men and women are paid the same] but I also have a few conservative views like this one; now I just want to say, I have no problem with girls playing with trucks or boys playing with dolls. However, I don't agree with Target making everything \"Gender neutral\". If someone wants to dress their boy in \"masculine\" colors or their baby girl in \"feminine\" colors, then let them do it. The same way vice-versa. However, I think that getting rid of gender specific toy aisles is stupid because it just makes it harder for parents to find their children toys; some boys want masculine toys, just like some girls want feminine toys. If a girl wants a masculine toy, the parent could easily go to the boy's section and buy a toy from there for his or her daughter; in fact, my parents did this often. However, what I don't agree with is dressing (young) boys in girl's clothes or painting his nails. I don't really think parents should be discussing this sort of thing until the child is a teenager (or around that age). Another thing I noticed is that many \"SJWs\" have said that buying masculine toys for boys makes them masculine. Surely buying feminine toys for him would make him feminine if this was the case?\n\nTL;DR, I think boys and girls will act masculine or feminine when they grow up regardless of the toys they are given or the clothes their parents give them."}

I see this often being used to defend road ragers and drunk wife-beaters. I can't agree with this argument because it unfairly takes responsibility away from the criminal. If we left every criminal go easy because the crimes were \"emotional\" or \"spur of the moment\", we'd have a lot of unstable people out on the streets ready go to off at any moment and hurt others.\n\nAnother argument I hear is that the criminal was a \"victim of the circumstances\", i.e. he was poor or grew up in a dysfunctional family. This is a totally reasonable argument if the crime is non-violent, but being poor or traumatized is not an excuse to kill somebody or even go beat someone up. Anyone who makes a conscious choice to hurt someone physically is simply an asshole.\n\nI oppose the death penalty and am in favor of restorative prison reform, so I hear people giving these criminals moral slack (at more than just a legal or health-based level) all the time, and it drives me crazy.

If you work fast food your whole life, that is your career\n* minimum wage job - Any job, usually in the service industry, that generally requires little to no formal education, and generally pays between the federal minimum wage up to and including $15.00/hr.  \n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMinimum wage is a hot topic of debate these days, and I'm sure a lot of visitors to this sub are tired of talking about raising, lowering, or eliminating the minimum wage but that isn't what this is about.  I did a search and couldn't find anything else that was similar to my stance so I'm hoping it will foster some new discussions.\n\nDuring every debate concerning minimum wage someone will always say something to the effect that \"minimum wage jobs aren't meant to support a family/are meant for teenagers and unskilled workers\" and I think that this line of thinking is just outright wrong.  \n\nThroughout the past 50 years, people took minimum wage service industry jobs when they were young/inexperienced in order to gain the experience that was required in order to land a production career.  That was the viewpoint, you got a minimum wage \"job\" in order to get the experience to start a \"career\" in the production world (whether directly producing something, or supporting those who do ie office staff, vendors, logistics, etc.).  \n\nAlso over that time, the economy in the US has gone from production based to service based.  This has caused a severe drop in production \"careers\" leaving nothing but the service industry left.  The service industry is now the career simply due to lack of other options.\n\n I joined the military when I was 20 years old because after working in the service industry at minimum wage for 5 years I finally landed a production job on an assembly line (this was in 1998). The money was better than anything I'd made previously, but not good enough to get ahead.  I ended up getting my girlfriend at the time pregnant and I saw the future that my current position offered and I wanted more so I enlisted. I spent 10 years working as an Aviation Electronics Technician before getting out to accept a position as a Federal Law Enforcement Officer with the US Forest Service. I worked at that position for 5 years before losing my job through no fault of my own. So there I was, a very highly skilled electronics tech, with 5 years of law enforcement experience, living in an area where 80% of the available jobs are minimum wage service industry and I needed a job. I applied everywhere....I mean everywhere. I filled out applications for Taco Bell, McDonald's, Walmart, etc. I got exactly 4 callbacks and 2 interviews during my job search where I was filling out 5-10 job applications per week...for 3 years before giving up. I couldn't get hired...why? Because for 15 years I made between $28-75k/year and every employer knows that there is no way I can support my family on minimum wage...and why would they pay me more when they can just pay someone else the minimum. I have been effectively unemployable in my current location since 2011 due in large part to the fact that everyone (including employers) knows minimum wage doesn't pay enough to support a single person, much less a family of six.\n\nI think the mentality that \"minimum wage jobs aren't careers and shouldn't pay enough to support a family\" is more destructive than it is beneficial.  \n\nTL;DR: Minimum wage jobs are no longer the sole realm of teenagers and the unskilled because the US doesn't produce anything anymore so those are the only careers available to most people. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. \n\nSecondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?\" \n\nIf you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a \"liar,\" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.\n\nSo that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? \n\n**EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it? I got a lot of deltas burning a hole in my pocket here....**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: Superman Returns is a better movie than Man of Steel.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ghw2z", "selftext": "As we all know, the viewers/stuidos/whoever were displeased with the reception of Superman Returns hence issued a reboot.  They did basically a polar opposite take with the reboot and we got whatever that Zack Snyder monstrosity.  Not only did I not like Man of Steel, but I thought Superman Returns was a decent film.\n\nSuperman Returns.  The more I rewatch it, the more I realize how they were trying to make a movie that was very authentic to the style of the Chrisopher Reeves movies.  The first thing we have to agree on is that Christopher Reeves those movies' portrayl of Superman are what everyone identifies as Superman.  So in a nod to that, Superman Returns is in that vein.  Brandon Roth carries himself a lot like Reeves did, the dialogue follows the same style, and so on.  Its a very charming and light portrayal of Superman which is how Reeves' movies did it.  The movie itself tries to never get too dark or serious, much like the originals.  Instead its about the character interaction, showing the marvelous feats, and kind of creating the world as it exists in the Superman mythos.  The movie is family friendly, funny at times, has a good cast of actors.  My only outright criticism is that they really took for granted the viewer's familiarity with the past Superman movies.  They basically wasted no time in backstory by just referencing the events of the other movies.  I think making this an extension of the Reeves films more or less outright was taking something of an extreme liberty.  \n\nBut Man of Steel is all in all a dark (literally and figuratively) film.  It gives a de jour emo  portrayal of Superman; moody, conflicted, enigmatic.  An excessive amount of time/scenes is spent on showing Superman's emotions and character building.  Christopher Reeves was just Superman, a guy who was just all-around iconic and always stood strong in the pocket.  Then Henry Cavill goes and lets his father die unnecessarily in a tornado?  Also Christopher Reeves barely cried in all four films, yet Henry Cavill has done so twice already in the first movie.  And would a Christopher Reeves movie ever end in him breaking the neck of his enemy right before a couple of children get vaporized?  The cinematography is dark and the visual effects look a lot like Green Latern (which probably isn't a good thing).  The backstory about Krypton is god-awful convoluted, unnecessary, and difficult to understand.  All the fighting seems inconsequential because aside from showing us constant grandiose destruction, we can't tell if the hits have any effect.  In the Reeves flicks, characters showed injuries, came up lame, grunted, cried out in pain.  In this one, Superman and his foes get knocked a quarter mile through concrete wall just to return the favor.  You absolutely never knew when the fight was going to end.  I could go on and on but those are some of the big points that seem to make it a lesser film to me.  \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Consider a single parent with two children; those are three people, not one and so surely their access to decision making should reflect this fact. Should there be better deals for families as a result of such an electoral reform (and perhaps worse deals for those without), is this not simply fairer and more reflective?\n\nFurther note that I'm aware there are other groups without the right to vote who perhaps should have it, but that is not the subject of this CMV.\n\n-----\n\nEdit 2: Far too many of people who've responded seem to think that a person's only motivation when voting can be self-interest.\n\n-----\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It's a huge profit center, even for \"non-profit organizations\" (most non profit college corporations pay huge salaries to their directors). \n\nAs for specialized high schools, throughout the country there are high schools that attract the higher performing students and gather them into an environment centered around accelerated and competitive learning. By the middle of a student's sophomore year (10th grade/ second year of high school), they have already been bombarded with information about countless colleges and college services. The students are pressured into buying services to give them an upper edge in the college admission process and are instilled with the fear that if they don't get into prestigious institutions they will have not lived up to their potential. The schools themselves even funnel thousands in public dollars to college services and advertising college services. Throughout my junior year (11th grade), I have missed at least four periods of English class because the school wanted us to attend a 40-minute long advertisement assembly for The Princeton Review (test prep service). I'm going into my senior year (12th grade) and watching how all my friends who also go to specialized high schools are being compelled to pour their parents money into countless services to gain an extra edge against other students. The specialized high schools even subtly shame students who pursue going to public universities like myself.\n\nBecause of all of these factors, I'm compelled to believe that specialized high schools are just places to gather the students who have high interest in prestigious universities and squeeze all the money out of their families into the US college industry."}
{"title": "CMV: USA was unjustified in bombing Japan to hasten the end of World War 2. The government of USA should apologize from the nation of Japan.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ggp32", "selftext": "Why I hold this view:\n\n1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\n2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? \nNo one would say yes.\n\n     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. \n\n\n3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.\n\n4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: \n\n\u201cJapan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\u201d\n\n\nWe erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.\n"}

I personally think that how the general populous' craving for violence while hating on sexual themes is very counter-productive (at least here in the US). I believe how we got this mind set is how violence and sex was perceived back in the Victorian Era where multiple wars were happening within the US and how the upper class thought of nudity as a \"lower class\" trait. This carried over into World War 1 and 2 where violence pretty much saved the US and made it into the giant economy it was and still mostly is today. And also during the Cold War, religion (mainly Christianity where sex is pretty much looked down especially with Homosexuality) was taking over and the US population perceived Russia as a \"Communist Atheist\" county. This old mindset has to stop and thus we need to move on into a more accepting culture. And I'm not talking about \"Oh let's just legalize Pedophilia and Bestiality\", I'm talking about treating sexual themes and violence in the same matter. Also I don't believe we should expose younger children to sexual themes as the same matter with extreme violence within our media.\n\nEdit: Well I have some real life stuff going on so I will see you guys soon had a good chat with everyone of you so yeah take care :)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

And I think anyone who's eaten at Arby's ever knows that that's just not true.  The food is great, it doesn't taste fast-foody at all, and most of it is downright mouth watering.

{"title": "CMV: Zoophilia should not be illegal", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3geb6x", "selftext": "\n\nFirst, I believe that if there is no valid reason for an activity to be illegal, it should not be illegal. If an activity is outlawed, and this provides no benefit, it hurts not only the offender, who is punished, but the society that must spend resources to punish them. I believe that the burden of proof should be on those who would outlaw something/keep it outlawed to provide a valid reason for why that should be outlawed.\n\nI believe that there is no reason sufficient to justify the illegality of bestiality/zoophilia. I'll be listing and responding to in this post some ideas others might see as valid reasons, mostly to save top-level commenters some time.\n\nreason 1: Bestiality threatens the animal's well-being and should therefore be illegal.\n\n-this is probably one of the most common arguments, but I believe it falls short. importantly, not all sex acts are necessarily harmful to the animal. While some CAN be harmful, these would already be illegal under animal abuse laws. it might be beneficial to add penalties to animal abuse with sexual motives, but even if it is, it could easily be accomplished without also criminalizing harmless sex acts.\n\nreason 1a: Animals cannot consent to sex, therefore all bestiality is rape, and should therefore be illegal.\n\n-another common one, which I'm semi-lumping with 1. it is true that animals are incapable of giving legal consent to sex. I challenge, however, that the legal and moral ideas of sexual consent in humans can be copypasted onto animals in the way that those who call all bestiality rape seem to be doing. First, nobody (well, not very many people) care about the consent of animals in other important areas. We capture, contain, breed, sterilize, perform experiments on, give invasive medical procedures to, euthanize, and eat animals on a regular basis, and we never ask the animals for permission first. While it's true that some of those are done for the animal's own benefit, which they couldn't understand, others are done because we don't give a shit about what the animals think. This view has lots of opponents, of course, but is currently accepted by most legal systems. Why, then, should the law suddenly care about the animal's consent when it comes to sex?\n\nanother distinction is that a healthy human will be able to, at some point in their lives, give consent. When they can't, it's usually  because of a temporary condition, such as childhood, unconsciousness, or the effects of a mind-altering substances. Consent, therefore, is usually a voluntary decision on the part of the person, and not giving consent is often implicit or explicit  indication that sex is actively unwanted. \n\nAnimals, however, are never able to 'give consent' in the commonway, regardless of health, age, or any other factor. However, since most species have been fucking for hundreds of millions of years, it's a safe assumption that a lack of consent doesn't always indicate that sex is unwanted. Now, I'm not saying that it's impossible for bestiality to be 'rape' in a meaningful sense; animals could certainly resist and experience distress during the process. However, like physically harmful sex acts, this could (and should) be covered under animal abuse laws, without criminalizing instances of 'rape' where the animal is either neutral or enjoying the experience.\n\nreason 2:Bestiality threatens the zoophile's well-being and should therefore be illegal.\n\nThis could probably be a post in its own right, but it's my belief that mentally abled adults should not be bound by laws 'for their own good'. and, for the most part, these laws fortunately don't exist that much. it's not illegal in most places for people to jump off a cliff or drink bleach, and if that's valid I see no reason why it should be illegal to engage in dangerous activities with an animal, sexual or otherwise (outside of what would be abuse, of course).\n\nreason 3: bestiality can threaten the well-being of third parties, and should therefore be illegal.\n\n-there are two parts to this I can think of: spread of zoonoses (diseases spread by animals that affect humans) and harmful learned behavior of animals.\n\nSexual activity, of course, allows for easy spread of disease. A zoophile, could easily, therefore, catch a disease form an animal and spread it to others. however, sexual contact is not the only way to transmit most diseases, which means this is another issue that could be covered by a law that also covers other possibilities without punishing 'safe' activity.\n\nanother concern by some is that animals used to having sex with some individuals will harass or rape others. This is a genuine concern, but considering animals can also be deliberately trained to, say, attack and kill humans, this is once again an issue that is not unique to animal-human interactions involving sex, and could be covered by other laws (probably involving negligence) without punishing owners of well-trained animals.\n\nreason 4: Zoophilia is prohibited by X religion and should therefore be illegal\n\n-Hope I don't have to with this much. seperation of church and state, I assume that's accepted by most of you.\n\nreason 4a: Zoophilia is an abomination/crime against nature and should therefore be illegal.\n\n-whatever an 'abomination' or a 'crime against nature' is now, people ten or twenty years from now probably won't agree with you. these labels are completely arbitrary, and any support for them is usually pseudo-mystical reasoning that is formulated to support existing opinions. Let nature punish crimes in her own courts, not the taxpayers'.\n\nreason 4aI: zoophilia is disgusting and should therefore be outlawed\n\n-basically 4a, but not as pretentious. Disgust is completely subjective and has no place in law, especially if the digusting activity is done in private.\n\n\nI think this covers most of them, but I'm interested to see counterarguments to my responses and other potential reasons."}

However, it makes sense to choose Sanders as the candidate to interrupt, rather than anyone else", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3gdtg4", "selftext": "I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.\n\nFirst, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.\n\nSecond, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says \"Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . .\" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.\n\nSanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to [O'Malley's page](https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.\n\nForcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Abortion is morally equivalent to murder.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3gdnyt", "selftext": "I am non-religious, I hold liberal beliefs in most social issues, and I firmly believe that abortion is morally equivalent to murder.\n\n\nTo begin, I want to address the ongoing argument of whether or not an unborn fetus is a person. This discussion, while minorly relevant to the issue of abortion, is not a productive topic to argue over. I believe a fetus is a person in the same way an egg is a chicken. In some regards it is, but in others it isn\u2019t. Regardless, the arguments for my beliefs still hold even if we accept that, no, a fetus is not, in any sense of the word, a person. \n\n\nHowever, even if a fetus is not a person, I believe that the *value* of a fetus is equivalent to the *value* of a person. To show this, we must examine why we attribute value to human life at all. I believe that the value of human life is in its potential. A human life has the potential to do good in the world, have positive experiences, and, in some way, be a source of value.The reason that we hold death as such a misfortune is because it robs a person of all possible future good. The experiences, relationships, activities, and choices of the future are, overall, tremendously valuable and the source of much happiness. Murder is such a reprehensible crime because it deprives it victim of so much value. \n\nA human fetus has an equally, if not greater, amount of potential for future experiences and pleasure in comparison to a person. Thus, is should follow that to deny the potential of a fetus would be morally akin to doing so for a born person.\n\nFor a far more in-depth argument, Don Marquis's paper \"Why Abortion is Immoral\" offers some very compelling arguments. While I take issue with a few points, the paper is mostly in line with my beliefs in the matter. [Here is a link, if you are interested.](http://bama.ua.edu/~jklocksiem/221/marquis_wai.pdf ) '\n\n\nEdit: 9:30 EST - I'm going to be off for the night, but I'll try to respond to any new comments tomorrow. Feel free to send a PM if you want to continue a discussion privately (or begin a new one!) Thanks so far for your thoughtful questions and comments."}
{"title": "CMV: A forearm tattoo will not negatively affect prospects for higher education or employment.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3gdndp", "selftext": "The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as slacks and a button down) but would be visible in casual wear (shorts and T-shirt). \n\nSuch a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38% of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. \n\nFurthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone\u2019s chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. \n\nThe previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case. In an interview process, there is no chance that the tattoo will be exposed in formal clothing. If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. \nThis third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job. This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38% of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image. But even discarding these arguments, the possibility of an employer finding out about a tattoo covered by conservative formal clothing in professional situations is nil. \n\n(As some of you may have guessed, I have posted this because I am considering getting a tattoo and want to make an informed decision before doing so. I think I have carefully considered most ways that a tattoo could impact my life, but I wanted to hear some opposing arguments I may have overlooked and figured Reddit could help me out here) \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I also don't have the same knee-jerk association of unions and criminal gangs that seems to prevail in discussions I've watched americans have. \n\n---\nThat said, let's move into the meat of the disscusion. \n1) a libertarian economy is not interfered with by the goverment. You want to force people to sign slavery contracts? it's allowed. By the same token however, there are no laws preventing people from forming unions, or those unions taking action to promote the interest of their members. If [the industry can maintain blacklists](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/27/on-the-blacklist-building-firms-secret-information-on-workers), so can the unions. If ]a company decides to close stores to punish union members](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/walmart-accused-of-closing-stores-in-retaliation-for-workers-demanding-better-pay-and-conditions-10193668.html?origin=internalSearch), they run the risk of a rival firm that will work with unions taking the bulk of the sales in that area.\n\nAn antagonistic culture between unions and corporations is not the only option of course, and companies with forms that favour longer term thinking (like walmart, ironically) but also Waitrose in the uk (employee owned) might thrive when others get bogged down in strikes and penalties.\n\n2) unions get more and more effective the larger they get. At heart, they are simply rebalancing the power between a huge corporation and a single worker. The largest unions appeared in nationalised industries - the largest conglomerates of the day. There is a strong selection pressure for small unions themselves to form alliances, or even full unions with each other to increase their bargining power. An ineffective union will loose members to a more effective one and the market will deliver :)\n\n3) the unions themselves suffer the problem of free-riders. People who do not join but benefit from the union driving up minimum working standards and safety. If providing things like out-of-work support costs the union (and thus the corporations they work with) then companies that manage to avoid using union workforce will face a slight advatnage. As such, for strong unions, it is wise to agitate for political change, so that all workplaces have to conform to those same standards, that union type out of work support have to be applied to the entire workforce to prevent more predatory models from gaining a competitive advantage.\nThis also has the advantage, especially at the minimum level of starvation, slavery and loss of limb I've seen, of being a moral thing to do. \n\n4) Some people may have a very high risk tolerance (for whatever reason), and want to do without the safety nets and complain at the cost or inconvenience it puts on them as an employer, employee or as a tax payer. They will continue to complain, but when their individual demands conflict with organised forces, whether as a corporation, worker's union, or an insurance company, they will loose."}

In terms of just the logistics, it just seems better than having one huge department for so many people (e.g. IRA) and I find it bizarre how we talk about certain issues like gun control when different gun control laws would be better for their each individual region. \n\nIt would mean more democracy.\n\nAnd it's not just the US. I think most world borders seem outdated to their current population...possible Brazil.. and China and India would split into a lot more different states. (Yes, I know how ridiculously unlikely this sound, but it's just my opinion.)\n\nFurthermore, some countries seem to be so economically intertwined it seems like it would benefit them to fully merge together. Benelux, the Baltics, (I would say the Balkan but nobody likes Serbia apparently,) the Nordics, Central Asia, (not sure how the rest of the Caucasus feel about Azerbaijan)\n\nYou guys know what I mean.\nMy point is that yes, I know this is unrealistic and probably never gonna happen, but truth be told, I believe it would be better for the individual citizen and more democratic for each newly created country.\n \n\nEdit: if anybody else have anything else to say, **please** feel free to do so! I'm greatly curious to your opinions on the hypothetical changes for each region. What language would be spoken? What currency would be used, and how? Let me know your opinion!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I have dead friends, \"burn-out\" friends and friends who smoke 420 blaziken MLG pro Monster blunts daily with minor anxiety and side-effects.

{"title": "CMV: The rise of political correctness has been almost entirely beneficial and does not restrict freedom of expression.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3galiq", "selftext": "Or to clarify, the things that currently are generally labeled as \"PC\" are being unfairly targeted. I'm more precisely referring to elements of the modern social justice movement as well as other typically liberal movements surrounding it. \n\nThe main impetus for my current view is that nearly entirely, when someone blames \"political correctness\" for silencing their views, those views are in some way bigoted and, for that reason, don't deserve to be taken as serious alternatives. \n\nA recent example where I noticed the idea that political correctness is a negative being employed is when Donald Trump countered Megyn Kelly's question over his crude remarks against many prominent women, by not only doubling down on them but also promising that he won't succumb to political correctness. I found this an obvious and cheap attempt to justify his own misogyny. \n\nOf course, accusations against political correctness are used elsewhere in much more subtle situations. Examples include, the American right accusing liberals of trying to disassociate Islamic terrorism with Islam itself, or any one of many other attempts to be sensitive towards particular groups of people, who, in my view are often unfairly targeted due to associations they have no control over.\n\nOther situations where I've heard disparaging remarks against the rise of political correctness are extreme situations where it's abused to the benefit of someone that wants to sue or wants wants to take things too literally or tries to read too deeply into certain statements. I believe that those situations are in fact rare and don't represent the actual views of most self proclaimed members of the current social justice moment. For example, I think I would agree that trying to replace Santa's \"ho ho ho\" with Santa's \"ha ha ha\" wouldn't make any sense since there is no intended connection with attempts at disparaging women in that. \n\nI think that ultimately, today we have a society that's becoming increasingly more self-aware of its faults and has led to better work environments for women and minorities because of political correctness. It represents a step forward from when overt racism/sexism became unacceptable since we've today learned to acknowledge the effects of subconscious bias and more subtle forms of discrimination and how discrimination in the past has trickled down into elements of modern society.\n\nInteresting questions that do arise, however, are to what extent should sensitivity in our language be promoted/enforced? Or how do you determine whether or not an offensive joke crosses a particular line? I think as long as we're not actively imposing criminal penalties to people for simply making sexist remarks, for instance, we should be fine as a free society. \n\nEDIT: I realize that political correctness is primarily a pejorative term used on issues related to the modern social justice movement. I should have been better with my use of terminology because of its broader meaning in the context of past social changes. My point is that what generally receives the PC label is usually a step in the right direction that is being unfairly targeted. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even without that dynamic, it would have already been a very tough electoral race for the GOP.\n\nSo unless they nominate Trump, the GOP will definitely lose the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIf Trump does get the nomination, he could max out his electability by picking John Kasich, who is the least offensive Republican to moderates and liberals and who is also popular in Ohio, a key swing state.\n\nThat would show that Trump can make smart political decisions, which could further sway independents and moderates who are tired of establishment politics.\n\nWhat's happening right now is that the GOP establishment does not like having a candidate who is not in their pocket, so they are trying to sink Trump's candidacy in favor of Jeb Bush (or maybe Rubio), who will also pick John Kasich as his running mate.\n\nBut Jeb's candidacy would be sunk not only by it being George W. Bush's brother running, but also by Trump's running and the electoral map favoring Democrats.  A Rubio/Kasich ticket or Jeb/Rubio ticket would be sunk for similar reasons.\n\nSo Donald Trump is actually the most electable Republican presidential candidate, and a Trump/Kasich ticket is the most electable Republican ticket. \n\n(Maybe a Trump/Floridian ticket would do as well, but it probably wouldn't be their best chance.)  \n\nCMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen.\n* Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio.

I have torrented rarely for probably 5 years, but I would consider myself on the bottom end of piracy. I subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime and Spotify, and usually buy my games on steam. Because of these services I never pirate music or games ever, and I usually do not pirate Television or Movies either.\n\nAs an aspiring filmmaker myself, it feels hypocritical to steal someone else's hard work, and so if at all possible I do not do that. I am more than willing to pay 3-5 dollars to rent a movie I want to watch. But this is not the internet we live in. While some movies are available on youtube, itunes and amazon instant for rental, many are either only available to buy or not available at all. On top of that, these services tend to have a charge to rent the \"HD\" version of the film, a practice I believe to be archaic and stupid in an age where everyone has HD monitors and/or TVs. \n\nIn my mind, if there were a service that made a huge selection of films available for a one-time viewing for $5 easily and at full quality -- with options for downloading if need be -- I personally would never pirate films or TV. \n\nHowever, this may not represent the consumer base as a whole and may not be enough to save the companies afraid of the internet. \n\n(WARNING: I AM GOING OFF WHAT I HAVE READ IN THIS SECTION -- I DO NOT HAVE SOURCES FOR MY CLAIMS YET) \n\nWhile Spotify does seem mitigate piracy, it also does not give much money to artists as a rule. But, at the same time, most artists make their money from touring and not from album sales, as the record label would end up taking most of the money from itunes/CD sales anyways. So part of me thinks that in this open age that perhaps it is the companies that should fail, if they cannot accept the internet's existence, freeing the artists to receive more money for sales directly from services such as Spotify and iTunes. The same applies to movies, television (which Netflix has helped a lot, I think) and games (I don't know many people who pirate games, since they are readily available on Steam and GOG.com as a rule) as well.\n\nTL;DR -- I think the companies fighting piracy should give up and try to mitigate it instead -- adapt rather than fight. \n\nWhat do you think?

This comes from the fact that beer drinkers don't have any reason to drink beer other than to, essentially, weaken their consciousness to make socializing easier. What other reason could there be? \n\nFacts about beer:\n\n* Way more expensive than other drinks\n\n* Unhealthy and very fatty\n\n* Puts you at risk of stupidity (drunk driving, people taking advantage of you, losing your belongings, etc.)\n\n* Tastes bad __&amp;#0042;__\n\n__&amp;#0042;__ I believe that objectively beer is less tasty than other drinks like orange juice, bubble tea, or a soft drink. Do you really think someone that has been drinking those drinks their whole life would taste that strong bitterness of beer and say that they like it, let alone saying that they like it more than coke? Almost impossible. I think those people are very rare. \n\nBeer is an *acquired taste*, and when I say acquired, I mean that it needs to be associated with the socializing that it begets for a long time before someone would like it - and they'd only be liking it because of that conditioning - not because of beer's actual taste. \n\nSo what is the problem with doing it for social reasons? People are essentially saying \"I don't trust my own consciousness to socialize and instead of working on improving I will socialize the easy and guaranteed way that requires artificially altering my personality.\" Unless people have some kind of mental illness causing them to have very high social inhibitions, I do not believe beer is a good way to solve their problem of having difficulty to interact with others. I think it is just a way to avoid the problem - one that's definitely possible to solve. I'm saying this as someone that used to be extremely shy and underwent major changes in the past few years. \n\nI will concede that beer can possibly help someone work on their social issues, as in, having a little bit of beer just to get into the social environment when they're not used to it yet, kind of like with floaty tubes when learning to swim. The ultimate goal will be to *not* rely on beer anymore, so I don't consider these people to be \"beer drinkers\". \n\nTell me, what makes beer as a social-enhancer any better than steroids as a muscle-enhancer? Is it just the degree to which it affects your body or is there anything else to it? \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

(Only regarding hunting for food) \n\nThis isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a bit sadistic. Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. \nLets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me. \n"}
{"title": "CMV: Baseball is not an interesting, tactical or even skillful sport.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3g72ar", "selftext": "I'm from Australia where we grow up with cricket rather than baseball. The fundamentals are the same: a pitcher throws a ball at a batter, who hits the ball between fielders and then runs to a goal to score points.\n\nBut cricket is superior to baseball in every way. The fielders don't wear gloves. They cover more ground. The batter is allowed and encouraged to hit the ball in a 360 radius from where he stands, compared to 90 degrees in baseball. The field is far more customisable, making allowances for left-handed batsmen and bowlers (pitchers), the bowler himself, the weather conditions, the shape and size of the ground itself, the state of the match. Baseball field positions are more or less static. With the exception of an occasional bunt in baseball, it is more or less all out attack, whereas cricket teams must make constant adjustments to their strategy. Often cricket teams won't even try to get a batter out. \n\nThe area at which a baseball pitcher must aim is extremely small, limiting the number of ways the batter can deal with a ball in the 'strike zone.' Conversely cricket bowlers can and do aim at a batman's body in order to intimidate them, or pitch the ball in other areas in order to entice them to play risky shots that are likely result in an out. That is to say, the rules of cricket allow for players to have a much wider spectrum of playing styles than baseball does.\n\nInnings are longer in cricket which allows 'relationships' to develop between batters, and tactical battles to evolve between opposing batters and bowlers. In baseball a pitcher and batter will only face each other for a theoretical maximum of 54 pitches per game (the reality is far, far less than this), whereas it is common in cricket for one batsman to face one bowler for hundreds of deliveries (pitches) per game. Cricket batsmen can choose whether to run or not, which requires a whole extra layer of strategy from both teams.\n\nThere is more. Cricket is to baseball as chess is to checkers.

This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. \n\n\nI realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.\n\nSadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.\n\nAdd to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.\n\nI didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker.

My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. \n\nMy POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?\n\n\nTl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is much less impressive, to me at least, to make an effective cutting implement when you have easy access to high quality iron and steel, as well as a large area of trade from which forging techniques can be adopted.

I don't see what denying refugees to enter your country has to do with liberalism, nor do I understand why people refer to racists as \"right wing extremists\". \n\nIn my opinion, liberalism (right wing) has nothing to do with immigration/asylum/integration politics. Therefore, it is uncalled for, to say that it is right wing extremists who are against accepting more refugees, as a true libertarian wouldn't mind more refugees, as long as they:\n\n1. Provide for themselves (and/or contributes to society)\n\n2. Doesn't interfere with your personal freedom (example: They don't steal).\n\n\nRight wing extremism would only be about fully applying the principals of liberalism. For an example: Lowering taxes to 0%. \n\nRight wing extremism has nothing to do with racism/xenophobia or immigration politics. CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, in discussing with my friends and stalking high school acquaintances on Facebook, I see a very strong correlation between people who are successful in life (well paying jobs, more stable marriages, waiting to have children until the can support a family) and people who left their hometown after high school - whether for college, military, or for work.  This is doubly true for people who not only left their hometown, but left their hometown not to the same state school that everyone else from my high school went to.\n\nI'm willing to listen to other opinions or evidence, but it seems that by people leaving their childhood friends and family that they become more stable and responsible adults.  A necessary consequence of this is that I always encourage teenagers to go to colleges away from home and not someplace where all of their friends are going.  Forcing someone to meet new people, re-invent themselves, and discovering how to stand on their own as an adult is in general a healthy thing to do even if it requires taking on a manageable amount of student debt vs. living at home and going to the local college.  \n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone for your anecdotes and experiences.  I agree that it is a correlation vs. causation argument, and that my anecdotal experience is related to my particular non-major metro area upbringing.  I also understand that there are a great many people who did not travel far from home, and are successful by any reasonable metric.  I was really hoping to see any data supporting or disproving my hypothesis, but seeing none, I'll just have to say that other peoples' anecdotes are just as valid as mine, and it's simply a correlation argument.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've been working in a startup for the last 3 years and it's grown tremendously. I make ~45K a year and have my own place with a few roommates - leasing a car, keeping busy with music... It all seems to be solid from all measures.\n\nBut it isn't enough. I don't have a girlfriend (likely due to a desperate vibe that I emit) and really find that to be the only thing I'm concerned with. I was in a relationship for 5 years - that ended 7 months ago, and I'm not yet over it. Before that, I had a 2.5 year relationship. A lot of thinking has led to a lot of learning - for example, I didn't end either of those relationships. Once I'm content... I never leave. That must be coming from a deeper belief/view at play.\n\nSo many cliches make sense, but are frustrating and have been functionally unhelpful:\n\nYou want what you can't have\nIf you love something let it go\nTime heals all wounds\n\nLogically, they all make sense - but from a deeper level, it doesn't seem to hit (or maybe I'd be changing how I view things).\n\nEven though it isn't a pressing issue at the moment, I haven't finished my degree - that will forever irk me (due to possible financial outcomes). Don't really have the drive to finish it.\n\nI've dealt with depression and it all seems to come down to a belief I hold deep down - that romantic relationships are the most significant thing in life. My last relationship ending was mostly my fault - I've learned what not to do moving forward, but don't have an opportunity to correct it with my last partner.\n\nI'm not looking for female friends - I'm looking for a lover, for a partner. Being able to sleep and wake up next to someone you care about is one of the coolest things I've ever experienced.\n\nMy view makes life very frustrating and unenjoyable without a relationship, which I don't currently have. I write to you here with a few things in mind:\n\n1. I'm not happy with how life is when single\n2. This is attributed to my worldview\n3. I realize that the significance I place on relationships is likely unhealthy\n4. I don't know how to change it\n5. I've spoken to many people about this (family, friends, therapist, ex's parents)\n6.

{"title": "CMV: The idea that free speech doesn't apply to private entities is ridiculous", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3g1pcd", "selftext": "Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be \"free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else\". If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/) will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.\n\nSecondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them.\n\nThe final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point.\n\nJust to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase \"freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences\" does not. \n\nEdit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some. I haven't missed the irony of the downvote button being used to disagree on topic about free speech, but I suppose there's always one. I have given out two deltas so far, but they tangential so the bulk of the view remains unchanged as I write this edit.\n\nSome people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest.\n\nEdit 3: Some people seem to be under the impression I want to expand the laws regarding free speech, probably because I'm a neo-Nazi Grand Dragon or something. That's not the case. I think the current situation I more than satisfactory. My view relates to the opinions towards free speech. To sum it up more succinctly, I don't think people can claim to be pro-free speech, when society is more than willing to restrict it. I'm *not* saying the restrictions are bad, I'm saying people should be more honest about them.\n\nA lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding.\n\n/u/Vordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/re-xkcd-1357-free-speech/), and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses.

He was in a bad relationship and decided to end it.

No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would. I mean, what if an officer showed up to the scene of a shooting (in which the shooter called 911 for help) and the shooter was there with the weapon and openly admitted to killing the victim in self-defense (which upon observation it was blatantly obvious it wad self-defense)? Surely the officer would draw his/ her weapon at the murderer and scream to get down. They would proceed to cuff them and bring them to the station for booking/ questioning. If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with \"hey are you okay?\" and \"Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave.\" That to me is hypocritical. Take away the uniform and you have a person who just killed another person.\n\n2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings.\n\n3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with giving a better chance for the true series of events to surface. We have seen A LOT of cops make up shit that \"justifies\" the killing when later proved wrong by cameras. If people could just make up stories and be believed 100%, I could go outside right now, shoot someone in the head while no one is looking, plant a knife, claim they came at me with a knife, and get away with 2nd degree murder.\n\nEven if an officer witnessed another officer kill a person when it was blatantly self-defense (eg the person had a gun pointed at the officer) they should still be cuffed and taken in. Just apply the same situation to 2 citizens, surely the one who lives would be charged with murder and only the results of an investigation would set them free.\n\nI'm just frustrated with all the bull shit I hear about cops and would like to hear the logic of the other side because I feel I'm blinded from it. So CMV.\n\nEdit: Okay, too many people are correcting me on minor technicalities which isn't helping. You **cannot** deny that there is an obvious bias when it comes to determining if an officer killing someone is justified or not, at least compared to a citizen killing another citizen.

I view it as a personal choice. While I don't think or feel any kind of way toward other parents wanting to be known to their children simply as mother/father, the idea has never resonated with me and I would personally prefer to be called my name.\n\nOffspring can easily acknowkedge a parent's role in their lives without referring to them only by the title of their relation to them in every interaction. To me, little would change. I see it as a matter of parental preference, like the kind of car driven. I can retain my individual identity without it interfering with or undermining my authority. If anything, I think that's a valuable lesson for a growing person to understand.\n\nI don't think simply being/not being called mother or father augments respect, bond or parental relationship dynamics if that is the family understanding. Of course, there is a difference when a family has an agreement to refer to the parents via parental title and the kid/s proceed to later call them by first name to ruffle feathers. That isn't the situation I'm referring to.\n\n The usual arguments against individuals who prefer to be called by their name rather than a generic mom/dad seem to be along the line of 'They're your child, not your friend', which in my eyes is a leap. Defining somebody by their label doesn't give their position more credence. Respect, authority, boundaries and understandings are established in countless ways more significant than being called by a title the kid should implicitly know is yours. If there is something wrong with all parties in a household being on first name basis that I am missing, enlighten me.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Tipping is a powerful economic force that improves service when properly applied", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3g0cde", "selftext": "I see many CMVs suggesting that tipping is bad, but growing up in a city that lives on tips and embraces tipping, I have a different view. Is my view unique to my community? Is it wrong?\n\nI grew up in Las Vegas where most service industry jobs both allow tipping and reward tippers with excellent service. Poor tippers quickly find that their behavior will result in poor service.\n\nFor example, casinos have cocktail servers who patrol the casino bringing drinks to players. When the server brings your first drink, you should tip them something (usually at least a dollar). If you tip average or above average, the server will return in a few moments to check on you and bring another drink if you need it. If you choose to not tip, you will likely wait much longer before you see your server again.\n\nBaggage handlers, valets, hosts and hostesses, front desk and even security are offered tips and are often empowered to enhance your experience. A brief read through the vegas subreddits (there are several) will lead you to many methods to use tips to get superior service while in Las Vegas.\n\nI've lived in other cities and visited many, many cities, both tourist trade and non tourist areas. Overall, the communities that accept and thrive on tips have better service, happier servers and more business because of it. When I have been in areas with a mandatory service charge, I find that service is not as good.\n\nWhile in New York City, I often talked to my servers about the mandatory service charges and indicated that I found it odd being from Las Vegas where tipping is encouraged. Often servers would agree to remove the service charge and allow me to tip what I wanted. This mutual trust made me memorable and my service was better because of it. I say this as I watched servers snub other patrons who did not engage the server and went with the standard charges.\n\nI read once that Penn Jillette (of Penn and Teller) lets servers know up front that he tips 25% *reguardless* of their service. He claims that he has never had bad service using this method.\n\nAs to claims of tipping encouraging racism, or female and blond servers getting higher tips, I would say that this is not unique to tipping. Pretty girls get lots of perks while they are young and pretty. No cover charges, free drinks, higher tips, etc. Unfortunately for them, these attributes quickly fade over time. Not having good service skills means their tips will fall off in their 30s or 40s. Again, this is not unique to tipping, this happens in nearly all non technical positions.\n\nAs to racism, many many servers are minorities and make great tips in Las Vegas. I would suggest that Las Vegas is a bit more progressive towards minorities than other cities, so again, I believe the problem is with regressive communities, not the practice of tipping.\n\nHelp me understand why this is not preferable to not tipping or banning tipping.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The homeless people in a certain two block area of Seattle have negative value as human beings", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3g04hc", "selftext": "**For clarity:**\n\n- I don't think that all homeless people lack value, just the homeless in this particular area that I walk through every day on my way to work\n\n- I believe that the majority of homeless people have jobs, but due to various factors are temporarily without a home\n\n- I do not believe that the majority of homeless people just use drugs and/or alchohol all day\n\n**For people that live in Seattle:**\nMy walking route is from the train station to the Seattle Art Museum building. The area I'm talking about is walking north on 2nd Avenue, between S Main Street and Yesler Way (on the other side of the street from the Union Gospel Mission)\n\n**My View:**\n\nThe people that loiter along this particular area of Seattle do not provide any value at all to society, and take more than they give. I do not value them as human beings, and if someone there was in need of help I would walk on by without providing any assistance. Here are the things that I see at least once a week, or every day that have created my view:\n\n- In the area where they loiter and sleep, there is always an immense amount of trash on the sidewalk. This is despite there being two dumpsters where they could take the trash to. *None of these people have a serious physical disability that prevents them from throwing away their trash, they just choose not to do it*. A city employee has to go through the area twice a day to clean up their trash. I did see one lady there with a broom cleaning up the area where she sleeps, but she was just moving the trash from the sidewalk to the street.\n\n- The smell of urine is constant, especially in the afternoons when the sun is out. There are at least alley corners where they could urinate, if not bathrooms. They just choose to pee right where they sleep (and people walk) though instead. Again, they are capable of not doing this but choose to do it anyway.\n\n- At least once a week I see the typical things that happen right before a fight. Tension build up, voices raised, body language, etc.. Rarely see this anywhere else in the city, just here. Again, they choose to do this.\n\n- People asking me for money \"for food\". This is probably the thing that most upsets me. In other areas, I don't normally assume the person asking for money is going to just buy drugs with it. In THIS area though, there is a place called the Union Gospel Mission that serves 3 meals a day for free, with no strings attached. The food isn't gross or anything, and it provides plenty of daily calories. How do I know? Because I volunteer there every week. They are literally standing across the street from a place that provides free frood, asking for money to buy food.\n\nThese people don't even respect the area where they've chosen to live, let alone respect the other people that have to walk through there. The city (with my tax dollars) has to send police, trash pick up, and a person with a street cleaner through this area every day just to keep it somewhat decent. This leads me to the conclusion that these people are only takers, and provide no value at all to the society that they live in. Therefore, I do not value them as human beings.\n\nEven in the (very rare) case of the person who is taking advantage of welfare there is value. They are spending money on things, and living in a home. That money goes into the economy, etc... Your average homeless person has value too, they probably have a job and contribute something to their society. I find none of that with this particular group of homeless living in this specific 2 block area.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This is fairly well accepted in modern society, although there are debates over 'souls' and things like that.\n\nI think that sentient AI will probably emerge first, long before we get close to digitizing humans, because of the way AI may emerge.

Much of the song's acclaim was for Alicia Key's singing/hook (which arguably made the song what it is), but the writing on the verses are quite overlooked. \n\nEspecially the third -\n\n&gt;Lights is blinding, girls need blinders/\nSo they can step out of bounds quick/\nThe side lines is lined with casualties/\nWho sip the life casually, then gradually become worse/\nDon\u2019t bite the apple, Eve/\nCaught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style/\nAnd in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out/\nThe city of sin is a pity on a whim/\nGood girls gone bad, the city's filled with 'em/\nMommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out/\nEverybody ride her, just like a bus route/\n\"Hail Mary\" to the city, you're a virgin/\nAnd Jesus can\u2019t save you, life starts when the church ends/\nCame here for school, graduated to the high life/\nBall players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight/\nMDMA got you feeling like a champion/\nThe city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien.\n\n\nExcellent use of imagery &amp; wordplay while still being fairly direct and evocative. This isn't much compared to some of the other writing on other hip-hop songs, but it showcases how good the writing is even on some of the biggest hits. I'm pretty sure that if some bands came up with even half of what some of the best hip-hop lyricists come up with, they would be endlessly praised. Might all seem very trivial, but I really feel hip-hop songwriting deserves more praise.\n\n_____\n"}

I will be back to converse in the morning, so keep the comments flowing! Edit: I'm back.**\n\n**Edit 2: Guys, I'm not here to argue the Problem of Evil; That is for another place and time. I would like to hear from a theist about why they believe homosexuality is a sin, or try to change my view with new information about translations of the Bible. Again, the morality of the rest of the Old Testament is not what I'm debating. Also, just because I answered initial slippery slopes does not mean that I'm willing (or mentally capable) of defending every one of a laundry list of qualms that you may feel about God's morality (or lack thereof) in the Bible. Thanks for reading!** \n\n**Edit 3: I understand that I'm getting disagreement from Atheists and Fundamentalists alike, but Downvotes Don't Change Minds! If I have done something wrong or misinterpreted your position, please tell me! I am more than willing to answer for any clarifications.**   \nHello CMV, practicing Christian here! \n\nI believe that far too many people (this will be reddit-centric) hold many ideas about the bible that reveal only a cursory (and often secondhand) idea about the bible. This post is largely in response to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3fsgbp/cmvbelief_in_christianity_does_not_necessitate/) one, which harbors several critical arguments including:\n\n1. Homosexuality is sinful as stated in the Bible\n\nand \n\n2. Christians who eat shellfish and wear mixed fibers are just as guilty of sin as homosexuals.\n\nNow, both of these views do not take into account the historical context in which they are presented in the Bible. I will start with point 2 because it leads into point 1.   \n\nMany people argue point two is ridiculous. Anti-theists use it point out the absurdity of the Bible, whereas (Liberal) Theists use it to point out the absurdity of Homosexuality being sinful. What this point fails to address, though, is the difference between [Moral and Ceremonial Law](http://www.gotquestions.org/ceremonial-law.html). From the website: \"The ceremonial laws are called hukkim or chuqqah in Hebrew, which literally means 'custom of the nation'; the words are often translated as 'statutes.'\" Rules such as not eating shellfish and wearing mixed fibers falls into this section. Now, main reason why people single out homosexuality is because Paul lists it as a sexual sin in the New Testament, and is among many of the other \"big sins\" often enumerated in the Bible, including killing, stealing, and lying. \n\nOn point 1, the question becomes why the compilers of the bible centuries ago felt compelled to add passages calling out monogamous same-sex relationships. [Unless, of course, it doesn't.](https://moanti.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/gaychristians/) The crux of the matter is that homosexual sex was used during antiquity as a means of humiliating and demeaning foreigners ( [as explained further in this link](https://moanti.wordpress.com/2013/07/07/the_bible_verse_most_christians_dont_like_to_quote/) ), and was therefore an act of **Rape**, distinct from the 21st century idea that two homosexuals can have a loving and fulfilling relationship.  \n\nI implore the on-the-fence theists reading this to examine the links provided as I also implore the atheists reading to use these links to please *call out* any of my so-called brothers and sisters who use the Bible as a tool for hate and power.\n\nThanks for reading.  \n\nEdit: I just wanted to clarify that I am arguing specifically about homosexuality as it is understood in society and in light if biblical interpretation.\n\nAlso, I am by not by any stretch of the imagination a biblical scholar, pastor, or the like, so be gentle please :)     \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

By a complete deus ex machina, Harry Potter was allowed to come back to life because \"Voldemort only killed part of his own soul\".

How many people think of Harry's \"death\"? I know I don't. Cause it didn't mean anything. If he had stayed dead, it would have been one of the most famous tragic moments in all of literature, given how widely read and loved Harry Potter is. \n\nI'm not sure how exactly it would end after that. My favorite way would be for Voldemort to be killed by all of Harry's friends who he has trained. Or even by the combined love of Hermione and Ron because the love theme is so strong in Harry Potter. Voldemort would still destroy the Harry horcrux when Harry died. It could end different ways, but the main point is that I think it would have been a great, if sad and tragic, moment if Harry died."}

Bigger than what they have now.\n\nAt least now, a man can compete against a more attractive peer in some circonstances by making more money, having a better status.

In fact, people often don't notice that I have them.\n\nPeople often say that they're unacceptable in office or professional settings, but I disagree. Not only have I seen people dressed for professional work wearing spacers before, but I believe the argument against them is weak, especially if you allow women to wear small earrings at work. My spacers take up as much space on my ear lobe as the average earring (maybe a little bigger), and I tend to wear them in mute or neutral tones, making them not distracting.\n\nI also believe that the definition of \"workplace appropriate\" here is subjective. Obviously there are parts of workplace dress that ought to be enforced, such as dressing somewhat conservatively and having clean, well-fitting clothes. But when workplace appropriateness allows earrings but not spacers, I believe allowing one but not the other is arbitrary. My spacers wouldn't be any more distracting than earrings, so I believe I have just as much of a right to wear them. CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Yes, jobs will require more skills and basic menial tasks may soon be replaced. But that is frictional unemployment, not structural. Its incorrect to say that because a McDonalds cashier got laid off because of a touchscreen order screen that said McDonald's worker will never work again. \n\nMany people on reddit would like to implement Basic Income today. They state that it would rid our problems with a complicated tax code, food stamps and other welfare programs. The huge issue is when you have a dead wage safety net you create a massive systematic disincentive to people to work. If people make a certain wage while working zero hours a week, why go get a job at the grocery store? The marginal value of a full time job becomes diluted. \n\nNext off, wages are considered elastic. Wages are often sticky, but they will still react to the market, especially new hires. If everyone is getting basic income, employers would simply cut costs and pay people less in wages because why not? Employees would be indifferent because they aren't netting less money, since basic income would make up the difference. Competitive wages would suffer. \n\nCMV \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Humans are actually a very primitive species. Crimes like murder and rape are to be expected, are not inherently immoral, and we overreact to them because they break order in society.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ftff4", "selftext": "Okay, this is a tough, long one to write out and explain, but I'll do my best. Currently I am actually having trouble understanding why these crimes are inherently wrong, other than that if they were not thought of as terrible, all hell would break loose and there would be no order. I am honestly open to changing my view (I even desire to change it, as I think I'm becoming extremely cynical). For some background I am in a graduate program in neuroscience. \n\nMoving on...I am sure someone might say \"well how would you like it if you/your family were raped/murdered\", but I feel that kind of reinforces my point - this reason just shows we are afraid of backlash, and thus order in society is necessary. \n\n---&gt; First of all, despite what we pretend to be, I honestly believe humans are actually very primitive. This means they are violent, still think with their \"reptilian brains\", and except outliers, are trying to fulfill their evolutionary/biological purpose - to create offspring.  Examples of what I see as proof for the primitive claim: \n\na) Perhaps some will point to the vast increases in science in technology as evidence that we are in fact not primitive, but 99.9999% of those increases come from 0.00001% of the population. Does the average human (on a global scale) really have anything to do with sending a man up to the moon or discovering a cure for a disease?\n\nb) Incredible amount of violence. The Holocaust was not too long ago...hundreds of thousands of soldiers/civilian supporters/etc all advocating for and carrying out genocide that killed millions. And that is just one example (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll). I don't believe that a handful of \"evil\" people could have carried these out - instead they were carried out by a group, albeit smaller, like 10% or so, and supported by something like 40%, and shown indifference by the majority of the rest. Again, need I mention ISIS, American acts against Natives, African tribe warfare, the list goes on. I believe every single human (yes you behind the computer screen) is capable of shocking violence or brutality. Our capacity and frequency of violence shows we are primitive.\n\nc) Factors in sexual attraction. This is a big one, because almost every single human is \"guilty\" of it. Both men and women will say they are looking for someone who is \"kind, intelligent, etc\", but much research has shown the most attractive trait women look for is height. The biggest reason for this is evolution - a bigger hunter/gatherer, protector, even dominator of women. Do women in cushy Western society today really need a big guy to protect them...I don't think so. For men, it is a combination of fertility signs (e.g. hip ratio) and youth. Again, personality goes out the window when you are looking at a woman with a beautiful figure. If you think about it, the sexual preferences of a human today (height, strength, resources for women...or beauty, fertility for men) are honestly closer to the sexual preferences of our closest relative, the chimpanzee, than to some mythical advanced human civilization that places the utmost value on compassion, intelligence, etc. Again, to me this shows that we are quite primitive.\n\nd) There is a similar primitive basis in other human ideas, like blind patriotism, or even racism in all aspects of society, from dating to careers (similar to animosity between tribes of chimpanzees, and attempts to maintain social hierarchy within tribes). Another one is harmful religious beliefs and traditions held by majority of humanity (showing a lack of understanding for science, progress). Not to bring another argument into this debate, but a good example is circumcision - 60% of male babies in the USA will be circumcised (99% for non-medical reasons), and 100-200 will die from complications, although thankfully there are a few societies, like Germany, where this is illegal, it still shows you how primitive we really are. Same thing (worse health effects for most types) on the other side of the planet with FGM. \n\n----&gt; Thus, I think we've fooled ourselves into thinking we have become so advanced (morally, scientifically) as a species and civilization. In fact, we are extremely primitive, and I think the outrage and shock that we feel when we hear of a rape or murder victim (or any other serious crime) is honestly just a farce. Of course I don't mean to say that people who feel sad and angry are lying, but I mean that our empathy here stems from societal teachings. \n\nGiven what we are capable of, given our track record in history, is it really so surprising if a man rapes a woman? After all, if we are this primitive, we are all just trying to spread our genes, create offspring, survive, reproduce, and so on.\n\nExample - I might say: Isn't it wrong that a compassionate, intelligent person will not reproduce if he/she does not meet the primitive biological preferences of humans today? Well, you would say: It might be wrong, but it's just because of the sexual preferences (read: primitive nature) of humanity. In the same way, you might say: Isn't it terribly wrong if a person rapes another, steals all their money, kills their enemies and competition? I might say: It might be wrong, but it's just because of the primitive nature of humanity. \n\n---\n\n**In summary: humans are actually very primitive, as is evident by their violence, sexual preferences, racism, and harmful religious practices. Murder, rape, theft is to be expected in such a primitive species. We overreact to these crimes because it disrupts the order of society, not because they are inherently immoral.**\n\nAnyway, please CMV! By the way, I talked about murder/rape because it is easy to feel empathy for the victims, but this extends to all other crimes. Also, no religious arguments please. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: Current Title IX interpretations, in practical terms, means only the man can decide if she can say yes.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ftbzs", "selftext": "With responsibility, comes authority.  Cases such as [this one](https://www.thefire.org/sexual-assault-injustice-at-occidental-college-railroads-accused-student/) at Occidental College.  There are other example cases as well, but this one is relatively 'clean' in that there was considerable documentation/evidence that both parties consented (and both parties had been drinking).  The man was expelled from school, the woman was not.\n\n\nWith this as a cautionary-tale/backdrop to the male decision making process, I come up with the following logic being the only reasonable interpretation for men to consider in terms of governing sexual relationships with women in college.\n\n\n1) If the woman says no, it means no, obviously.\n\n\n2) If the woman says yes but has had a drink, it's up to the man to determine if she still has the authority to consent, the safe answer being 'no, she does not.'\n\n\n3) If the woman says yes and has had **no** alcohol, it is up to the man to determine if she has the emotional maturity to consent at all (e.g., will she regret it).\n\n\n\nSo, she can certainly say no, but only a man can determine if she has the right or agency to say yes, and women are under no reciprocal obligation.\n\n\nThis doesn't feel like a very positive outcome for women, I feel it robs them of control over their bodies.  It would also seem to rob a happy couple of the simple pleasure of an evening at home drinking with some sex before bed.  However I am unable to arrive at another intepretation or approach that mitigates the risk to men given the current Title IX interpretation.\n\n\n**NOTE:** To be clear, I have no desire to undermine women's agency, and I am posting this in ernest with no ulterior motive, although I do recognize it may be a controversial subject.  I hope there is an alternative view that makes sense to me.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In fact, the notion that \"homosexuality is a sin\" is inconsistent with the theme of the New Testament, which Christians put much more emphasis on. In the New Testament, Jesus encourages believers not to judge the immorality of a person by what is socially acceptable, which is essentially what those who would say that homosexuality is a sin are doing.\n\n*edit.

Draws doctrine from the Qu'ran (a holy book) and the Hadith (the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). \n\n**Sheik** - An educated religious leader that are theological scholars, and have power to issue religious opinions/rulings, known as *fatwas.*\n\n\n\nMy case is this.\n\n* **Fighting Islamic Terrorism through military force DOES NOT WORK.**\nThe emergence of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh is strong evidence that foreign invasions cannot create stability in a country.\n\n* **A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance.**\nIslam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process. Lines of Sheiks are dying out due to a lack of willing students, and knowledge is being lost with them. The pull of Islamism on young men may be contributing to this.\n\n* **A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism** - The Qu'ran is a suprisingly thought-provoking text, even for the secular reader. It constantly promotes critical thinking, and warns against interpreting its verses in a dogmatic way. A study of the life of the Prophet (pbuh), where he only fought as a last resort and was firmly against the killing of non-combatants, is totally at odds with Islamists. The fact that modern Islamist organisations (eg. Al-Quaeda, ISIL) are theologically innovative (rather than trying to get back to 7th Century Islam) is something that Al-Quaeda openly admits and is one of their most obvious flaws to Muslim observers.\n\nMy solution is that the West, with its traditions of academic study and economic power at the greatest they have ever been, should help educate Muslim countries about their own religion. Education should be at the grass roots level, the theological, and academic levels. I think there is a rather poetic justification in that the Islamic Empire safeguarded many of the texts of Europe and the Greeks at the time Europe was going through its Dark Ages. A similar thing could be argued to be taking place in the Muslim World today. \n\n**TL;DR** - I think it would be more effective, more sustainable, and it would diffuse the antipathy towards Islam in the Western World. It answers a lot of the current political problems in Muslim countries and would help establish Islam as the progressive force I believe it has always been, rather than the regressive and conservative force people fear it to be. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  \n\nMy wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother\u2019s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master\u2019s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don\u2019t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent\u2019s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  \n\nI hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I\u2019ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don\u2019t completely buy into it.  I\u2019ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I\u2019ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don\u2019t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    \n\nTL:DR \u2013 The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  \n\nEdit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  \n\nEdit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  \n\nEdit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:\n\n1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  \n2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  \n3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   \n4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited\n5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.  \n"}

{"title": "CMV: With the proper classes, men and women could compete fairly in sports", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3fp1vy", "selftext": "**See update at the bottom**\n\nYesterday I suggested that men and women could compete fairly against each other in sports, **if** we split up competitors into the proper classes for the sport. In other words, instead of gender segregation - men's tennis vs. women's tennis, we would have multiple classes of tennis, based on physical attributes. The goal would be to pick classes in a way that gender doesn't matter, so everyone in class X has the same raw physical potential.\n\nFor some sports like boxing the classes would probably be the familiar weight classes: heavyweight, featherweight, etc. But I'm definitely not saying that those classes are the final word, and for other sports I'm not sure what the class criterion would be. Some possibilities include height, weight, % of muscle mass, % of different types of muscle, lung efficiency, and so forth. **The criteria for classes would be chosen by experts in the field based on objective criteria.**\n\nWhen I suggested this, I was basically downvoted into oblivion, told that this idea would destroy women's sports, that men are obviously superior to women so my idea doesn't even make sense, and mostly just told \"but men will still beat women\" many times.\n\nNow, of course, in the top weight classes in boxing men would dominate, simply because most people over a certain mass of muscle are male. But that's the point of having non-heavyweight classes in boxing - the other classes let other people compete fairly too.\n\nAnd likewise, in basketball, height is a huge advantage, and there are far far more men in the extreme high end of height, that I don't expect to see women there. But I would expect to see women in a height class of basketball which is low enough so that there are far more women than men (talking about adults here), and even more so if we also took into account % of muscle mass.\n\nI was told that Serena Williams, the top female tennis player in the world, lost to the 200th top male tennis player, and  I guess people infer from that that women are simply inferior to men physically. To which I ask: Are they inferior, **if** you control for % of muscle mass, weight, and other relevant factors to the sport?\n\nI don't see why women would be inferior in such conditions. Yes, women have less size and % of muscle mass than men, **on average**, but for two human beings **with the same** height/weight/muscle mass/etc. (whatever makes sense for the specific sport), but one is a man and the other is a woman, surely the competition would be quite fair?\n\nAs far as I can tell, there is no \"magic\" difference between male and female athletes. [There is no \"male muscle\" or \"female muscle\"](http://www.jaxtrainer.com/m-vs-w.html), it is just that men tend to have more of it.\n\nThe only potentially valid argument I heard against my idea was the claim that men have **so many** advantages - from big ones like amount of muscle, to small ones like shape of their hip bones - that if sports created categories based on them all, it would end up with men in one and women in the other, reproducing the current gender segregation, and that if that isn't taken to that extreme, then women will basically vanish from sports. I concede that is theoretically possible, and it would be hard for me to disprove it, but it goes entirely against my intuition on this.\n\n**edit**: It will **NOT** change my opinion if you say \"but the best female athletes can't compete against much more mediocre male athletes\". My proposal's entire point is to address that by defining classes in which to compete, defined physically and objectively. People would compete against their physical equals. So by definition, if it wouldn't be a fair fight for those women, they would not be in the same class. See the \"**if**\" in the very first paragraph.\n\n**UPDATE**: Thanks to everyone for all the discussion so far. At this point I'd like to summarize things up to this point, because it seems like 100 people are making quite similar arguments, and I don't have enough time to answer every person. I apologize for comments that I don't get the chance to respond to.\n\n * Many people say that women are just not good enough. Most people support that with anecdotes like this women's team lost to a team of teenage boys. I am not saying there is no value to such anecdotes, but:\n  * There are anecdotes going the other way, like Serena and Venus losing but not losing by that much to the 200th top male player. If Serena and Venus can beat everyone but the top 500 or so tennis players in the whole world, then they are doing amazingly well. If we split people also by some physical factors (response time? % of muscles? % of fast-twitch muscle fibers?), I don't see why they can't win in their own class, and the few hundred or so men that can beat them would be in the other class.\n  * Even if most professional women's teams currently lose to more mediocre men, we don't know how much of that is physically based. Part of it, as posters correctly brought up - this was a point I didn't realize before - was that women compete against other women, so they aren't getting challenged enough. For example, if Serena and Venus practiced heavily against male players, maybe they would have beat that 200th guy. And the best way to change this is to open up more cross-gender competition.\n   * To further see the importance of competition, look at [this article about the gender gap in sports](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/08/daily-chart-olympics). Female olympians would have won the gold against male olympians if they competed against the men from just a few decades ago, in several sports. Male bodies weren't much different then, so this isn't due to simple physical differences between men and women. The question is why scores - for both genders - improve so much over time. Better training techniques might be one thing, perhaps better shoes etc., but also better competitors that push you harder might be another. Overall, the fact that improvements keep happening in each gender, and that the best women of today would beat the men from the near past in many sports, does **not** support a simple explanation of \"men are just better and always will be\". (It doesn't rule it out either, of course.)\n * Other people say that women are just not good enough based on scientific data. This **could** convince me, but so far I don't see enough. For example, yes, women have less muscle mass on average, but AFAIK the science shows that the muscle they do have is equivalent to male muscle. So if we control for the amount (and %) of muscle, it should be fair, in sports where raw muscle is the crucial thing. But, if you find data showing that 99% of men have better coordination than the top 1% of women, I might be convinced on this. The criteria for my being convinced is, as I wrote in my last paragraph: If, to make the competition fair, we need to control for more and more physical factors, until the categories end up having all women in one and all men in the other (or 99.99% of all), then I am just recreating the current system, but with added costs but no benefit.\n  * Also, don't forget that we can create classes based on various factors, like a basketball team of people of height 1.60m. Since very few adult men exist of that height, I assume it would be dominated by women. So even if in a no-restrictions competition men would always win, if we limit by physical criteria, women can win in some classes. You can convince me I am wrong if you can show that even in a category like basketball 1.60m, that despite there being far, far more candidate women, men would still dominate it, and would do so even if we control for say % of muscle mass.\n   * And if you think 1.60m basketball sounds odd, I would say it is no more odd than lightweight boxing. It's actually a somewhat different sport, and interesting in a different way. I personally would be fascinated to see, just for variety, basketball played **not** by super-tall people.\n * Some people said that even if we find a way to split into physically-based classes, women would dominate the \"lesser\" ones. I do concede that more money goes into heavyweight boxing than lightweight. But, that is also already the case today with women's sports (compare the WNBA to the NBA), but those classes do well enough. I think my proposal could actually help, because I think making the classes more objective and having mixed-gender competitions would be novel and interesting.\n * Overall, I think a common thing happening in this discussion is that it seems obvious to most of you that women are just never going to be good enough, and I am asking for more concrete evidence for something which you take almost for granted. Of course, I agree it is hard to estimate how my proposal will work, especially when each sport would have its own criteria for classes, but I still think there is plenty of reason for optimism. So far my optimism has not been proven unjustified, as far as I can tell.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Gaston was the good guy in Disney's Beauty and the Beast", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3foikg", "selftext": "Gaston, the loud and boisterous dreamboat is known as the main Antagonist of Disney's Beauty and the Beast, and is arguably one of the most known Disney villains of all time, fighting and womanizing his way through the small French village before ultimately meeting a brutal end by falling to his death off of Beast's Castle and impaling himself on a spiked fence.  While Gaston is written to be the evil character in this film, I believe that it is unfair to put him in this light, and if anything, he's a good guy.  Here is my reasoning\n\n1.  Overwhelmingly, the villagers seem to absolutely adore Gaston, and not because of some shady shit where he's hiding who he truly is.  Everybody knows the true Gaston and yet they loyally follow him anyway, even into battle. I refuse to believe that this is because the village is populated entirely by villains, and instead it must mean that Gaston truly has a way of winning over people.\n\n2.  People often say that the way that he approached Belle in asking her to marry him was rude and misogynistic.  While I don't necessarily believe that any of these traits make a villain, I still think that it is unfair to paint him with any of these labels.  He approached her with great confidence, a trait that just about every woman likes in a man, and his track record of having every woman in the village swoon over him means that it's really not his fault that he expected Belle to be different. The fact that he even asked Belle herself as opposed to demanding her from her father shows that he probably really did care about her, especially since he probably could have done the former given the time period the movie is set in.  \n\n3.  The act that truly cements Gaston as the \"villain\" of the story is when (in what I think is the movie's best song), he rallies the entire town to go kill the beast, now at this point in the story, the beast had attacked and kidnapped Belle's father, and he also held Belle hostage during which he verbally abused her, kept her locked in her room, and even came close to physically assaulting her.  While the beast had gone through some personal growth during this period, Gaston had no way of knowing this, and none of that excuses the fact that he fucking kidnapped Belle.  So, disregarding his own personal safety, and acting out of anger for what has happened to Belle even though she brutally rejected and insulted him (a very selfless act if you ask me),  Gaston charges headlong into a castle to destroy this beast that he logically believes is a violent and dangerous creature, and then the story ends.  \n\nOverwhelmingly, I see nothing that shows Gaston to be  the evil sociopathic villain that Disney wants to portray him as.  In fact, I see him as a lovestruck and rightfully angered man, albeit a little bit egotistical, but hey, plenty of us are.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.\n\nAnother example: bankers.

{"title": "CMV: Approving the Iran deal is in the best interest of U.S. national security.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3fm8j7", "selftext": "I don't see a lot of discussion of the Iran deal on Reddit, which is surprising to me since I think there's a good chance it will wind up as the most significant foreign policy development of the Obama presidency.\n\n\n**Before I launch into my discussion of this issue, let me state the assumptions I'm making about how we evaluate America's national security interests:**\n\n\n1. The top strategic priority for the U.S. is to minimize the chance of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.  This would be considered the \"worst case scenario\" for the U.S. and its Western allies.\n\n2. The U.S.'s second strategic priority is to minimize the chance of the U.S. entering another ground war in the Middle East (i.e. the \"invade Iran\" outcome).\n\n3. The U.S.'s third strategic priority is to minimize Iran's capacity to support terrorist organizations (i.e. Hezbollah, Hamas) and engage in \"proxy wars\" with our allies (basically Israel and Saudi Arabia), as well as to push Iran to improve the human rights situation within its own borders.\n\n\nMy understanding is further that these priorities are strictly ordered, i.e. that 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 in importance, and that (for example) we would only want a better outcome in #3 if it did not come at the expense of #1 and #2.  If you disagree with the assumptions I'm making here, I'm willing to discuss them further in the comments.  But I feel pretty comfortable making these assumptions because pretty much everything I've read (both from the left and from the right, both in favor of and against the deal) has made more or less the same ones.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let's consider the possibilities on the table.\n\n\nAs I see it, when you push past the rhetoric and boil down what proponents and critics of the deal are saying, **there are basically only four options:**\n\nA. Approve the deal.\n\nB. Reject the deal with the intention of returning to the negotiating table for \"a better deal.\"\n\nC. The military option-- invade Iran for the strategic purpose of destroying their nuclear program.\n\nD. Do nothing (don't approve any deal and continue with the status quo).\n\n\nAlmost everyone seems clear that C is a terrible option.  As we saw in Iraq, our ability to achieve strategic goals through military force in the Middle East is limited.  We would be committing perhaps another trillion dollars or more, to say nothing of the massive loss of American and Iranian life (probably on a scale far greater than we saw in the Iraq war, due to the more advanced nature of Iran\u2019s military infrastructure), and the end result would be further destabilization of the region and more breeding grounds for terrorist groups akin to ISIS.  Some have suggested an air-war only approach, but this would not guarantee eradication of the nuclear program because of sites like Fordow, which houses a nuclear facility deep in an underground bunker.  Michael Hayden, who had been CIA director under George W. Bush, also makes a credible argument that an invasion would actually *cause* the creation of a nuclear weapon, since they would then pull out all the stops on producing one and we wouldn\u2019t be able to destroy their infrastructure in time.\n\n\nSo the military option is awful.  But in my reading, Option D (do nothing) is almost as bad.  If we do nothing, then there are no restrictions and no oversight on Iran's nuclear program from the West whatsoever.  There would be nothing to stop them from developing a nuclear weapon in as few as a few months.  Israel would likely invade Iran before they let that happen, potentially drawing the U.S. into a Middle East war anyway.  So the status quo is pretty untenable.  Even opponents of the deal tend to concede this.\n\n\nThat brings us to Option B, which seems to be the main conservative alternative to the deal.  The idea here is that we should leave sanctions in place, or even toughen them up, until Iran is forced to agree to a much more one-sided capitulation. \n\n\nThis sounds good in theory, but there are several reasons to think this is just unrealistic:\n\n* Russia and China are desperate to resume trade with Iran.  Whether we approve the deal or not, they are likely to repeal their own sanctions (frankly, it was amazing that Obama even got them to go along with the sanctions in the first place.)  Therefore, even if Congress passes tougher sanctions, overall economic pressure on the country will decrease, not increase, weakening our negotiating position.\n* The EU and our other non-Israel allies will blame the U.S., rather than Iran, for the deal falling through, and may even act to decrease their own sanctions.\n* Iran has to appease its own hardliners in government.  The Supreme Leader would not consent to any deal that didn\u2019t include some sort of \u201cface-saving\u201d provision, that lets them propagandize to their own people about their victory over the West.  Therefore, the chance of any deal passing that eliminates 100% of their centrifuges (a key demand of the American right) seems impossible.\n\n\nThe point has been made that Option B is basically the best-case scenario for the *Iranian* government.  If the deal falls through, then they get relief from the economic sanctions that have crippled their country (regardless of what Congress does), they are left with zero international oversight over their nuclear program and are thus free to chug ahead, and best of all, the *Americans* take the blame for the whole thing on the world stage.\n\n\nAdvocates of Option B point out that if we grant Iran any form of sanctions relief, it is likely that they will spend at least some of the money financing terrorist organizations.  As far as I can see, this is probably true  ([Iran no longer funds Hamas](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/10091629/Iran-cuts-Hamas-funding-over-Syria.html) but they do still fund Hezbollah, as far as I know).   But I also don\u2019t really see any way to avoid this without compromising Priority #1 or Priority #2, or more likely, both.  \n\n\nApproving the deal at least gets us oversight, in the form of IAEA inspections, which will have the right to go to any suspicious facility at any time for any reason.  Experts estimate that Iran would not have enough uranium to produce a bomb in less than a year.  If they attempt to \"cheat\" or deny access to inspectors, the \"snapback\" provisions will mean a return to crippling sanctions (and Russia and China won't be able to veto them.)  It's not a perfect deal, but as far as I can see it does achieve Priority #1 and #2 for the U.S.'s national security interests better than any other present option.\n\n\nIf George W. Bush had developed a more coherent Iran strategy beyond just \u201clet\u2019s have some sanctions and eventually they will capitulate to our every demand somehow,\u201d we would probably be in a much better negotiating position (and Iran would be much less far along in its nuclear development.)  He also pretty much destroyed the credibility of any military threat by demonstrating just how unable we are to advance our strategic interests through war in the Middle East.  But given the situation as it stands, I just don\u2019t see any reasonable alternative to approving the (admittedly imperfect) Iran deal.  CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I as a middle-income westerner live in far greater luxury than did Louis XIV, and I believe markets are the primary structural reason why.\n\nFurther, I believe that material wealth is a key source of human happiness and satisfaction in life - maximization of which is the core objective of a human-focused utilitarianism.  As some evidence for this, I would point to [this excellent paper by economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2013/04/subjective-well-being-income).  It finds, from a truly enormous number of studies, a robust linear-log relationship between income and reported happiness or life satisfaction.\n\nThird, I believe that pro-market policies are likely to continue to promote economic growth.  As evidence, I would point to the massive reduction of poverty in China since the adoption of a a private market system, which is probably the single greatest humanitarian miracle of the past 100 years.\n\nNow, I should define my terms a bit here.\n\nWhen I say non-radical libertarianism I mean a model of the state roughly in line with modern liberal-democratic states.  In general, that would include the existence of some level of a welfare state, nor of progressive taxation schemes.  It would however strongly favor policies in that vein which minimize market interference - so things like cash transfers as opposed to in-kind transfers or government provision of goods and services.  It would also include a robust protection for the right to private property, and for civil and political rights.\n\nAs an example of where this would diverge substantially from current policies of liberal democracies, the right of people to migrate between countries is a key civil right which produces I think extraordinary human wellbeing which is routinely denied to people.\n\n**TL;DR:**  Libertarian pro-market policies make more stuff than other policies.  Stuff makes people happy.  Happiness is the goal of utilitarianism.  Ergo, libertarian pro-market policies effectuate utilitarianism more than other policies.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Batman is a violent, fascist asshole", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3fj8ie", "selftext": "Think about it this way: would you approve of federal funding to support a special task force of batmen in every major city in America? The batmen are well paid and highly armed with military grade technology. They can use theatrics to scare people. They operate outside the law, do not require evidence or due process of any kind, and suffer no penalty for excessive use of violence. The argument in favor of this is that the batmen can better intimidate, scare and ultimately beat up low level criminals, which will reduce crime.\n\nThis solution assumes that a) crime is a major problem, b) only bad people commit crime and c) they will only stop committing crime through the threat of violence. It does nothing to address issues of poverty, inequality, domestic violence, mental illness or any of the myriad of other social issues that lead to crime. Having batmen patrol the streets of any city is an absurd extension of a modern police state.\n\nI think this is really what the story of Batman is though. It romanticizes a lone vigilante who carries military grade weapons, uses theatrics to scare people, operates outside the law and suffers no penalty for excessive use of violence, which he frequently resorts to. He is trust-fund baby who is motivated by childhood trauma which he has failed to deal with in any sort of mature way. Batman is really just a mentally disturbed violent anti-social psychopath who is an agent for the wealthy elite and whose tactics resemble fascism taken to an absurd extreme. He is a villan, not a hero. CMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Your brother got shot by a cop? How dare you even *think* about so much as shooting a cop's brother. This is ridiculous and ineffective; the few times that nonviolence has actually been successful it has occurred in the face of greater violence. The peaceful dissipation of the British Empire occurred not because of Gandhi's or Nkrumah's fortitude but instead because the horrors of the Second World War made Blighty respect African and Asian fighters as their equals on the battlefield. When you're dealing with an establishment that sees both Jamal from Ferguson and Voula from Lesvos as equally dispensable, there is no way to nonviolently deconstruct this system.\n\nOn the contrary, violence against children has proven to be one of the most enduringly successful tactics; as heinous as it is in the microcosm, in the macrocosm it yields very successful results for a noble cause. One can see this in the Old Testament, where the Israelites showed no compunctions towards killing small children and were rewarded with a defensible state, and in modern times the success of the State of Israel as well. You see the same in ISIS; they show depraved indifference towards civilian life and as a result their enemies shut down because their lizard brain cannot condemn a baby-killer. If those who fight against imperialists (in the US, Europe, Canada, Ukraine -- both sides are imperialist scum -- etc) used the same tactic, the global system would not see the threat they faced until it was too late.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The end of Moore's Law will drastically reduce the pace of technological change", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3fh9vg", "selftext": "A few years ago, the CEO of Intel said that if cars had developed as quickly as computers, they would go at 470,000 mph, get 100,000 miles to the gallon, and cost 3 cents. This got me wondering, what would the world be like if computers developed as slowly as cars?\n\nWith the delay of Cannonlake to 2017, we have the first objective signs that Moore's law is slowing down, and most experts seem to be predicting it will come to an end within the next ten years or so. This is significant since shrinking components is really the \"low-hanging fruit\" of the computer industry, with each shrinkage allowing 60% more transistors (which allows the processor to do more things) and having 60% lower power consumption (fairly important for mobile applications). Outside of just processors, shrinking transistors are also a key enabler of increasing SD card sizes and SSD drive storage.  \n\nThe increasing speed/power ratio of processors, and the increasing ability to store large files on solid state memory, have enabled practically every computer-related technology. PCs, digital cameras smartphones, tablets, smart watches and the like all began their lives, and continue to improve rapidly, thanks to Moore's law. \n\nOnce Moore's law stops, all of these devices will stop improving at such a rapid pace. There will be no more iPads which double in speed from one generation to the other, no more laughing at the phones from 5 years ago.\n\nI am well aware of the developments relating to graphene, optical computing and the like, but I believe that they will end up improving much slower than the old improvements of Moore's law, i.e. they are \"high-hanging fruit\" which will be slow to market and slow to improve. In other words, I am aware that computers will keep developing, but I feel they will develop at the same speed as cars, where a model from ten years ago is outdated but not really all that different. \n\nHaving computers/mobile devices/other electronics which grow at a much slower rate will sap much of the dynamism from the entire technology sector, as fundamentally new software and applications often grows from the enabling factors of new hardware. The entire world of technology will grow at a similiar pace to the car world, where improvements in engine efficiency and the like are constant and gradually, and kind of boring. \n\nAs a technology lover, I really hope I'm wrong about all this, so I hope someone can Change My View! \n\nEdit 1: Delta awarded to Omega037 for pointing out that cloud computing may make restrictions on speed and storage in end user devices irrelevant. However, the issue of stagnation at the server farm remains. \n\nEdit 2: Delta awarded to forestfly1234 for pointing out that \"Slow or even slower innovation doesn't mean that mind blowing, experience altering change wouldn't happen.\"\n\nEdit 3: Delta awarded to Armadylspark for pointing out that [3D chips](http://electronicpackaging.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=1849813) could easily allow a similiar magnitude of growth in chip speeds to Moore's Law for quite some time, even once the process of transistor shrinkage ends. \n\nEdit 4: Delta awarded to wellACTUALLYdtdtdt for pointing out that innovations may lag behind the hardware improvements that enable them by many years, e.g. Uber, AirBnB, online dating. Bonus imaginary points for the beautiful quote that \"the post-transistor age will be one of pure ideas\", now I'm excited about the post-Moore era. "}

This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical\u2014while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM.\n\nOf the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is \"Shut Up and Dance\" by Walk the Moon, at #9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's \"Trap Queen.\" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. \n\nTame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. \n\nI would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock\u2014Kendrick Lamar's *To Pimp A Butterfly*, Drake's *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*, Mark Ronson's *Uptown Special*, Taylor Swift's *1989* (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop).\n\nThere has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. \n\nI don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, R&amp;B, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year). But I think that rock has lost its importance in the wider culture, and that rock music is now even imbued with an inherent feeling of throwback, the way that jazz now makes people think of a certain time period even as jazz continues to innovate to this day.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I am still 10 pounds shy of my goal weight, and when I reach that weight I will modify my diet to eat at a 0 calorie deficit/surplus, that is I will eat according to my TDEE.\n\nIn order to help myself have the willpower to do this I started to allow myself to enjoy all of my favorite snacks and junk food but instead of swallowing I would spit it out, usually into a separate bowl that I would then dump into the toilet and flush. This allowed me to enjoy the taste and experience of eating the food, which is what I was really always after, without affecting my weight loss goal, and it worked, very well.

{"title": "CMV: After an apocalypse, society would lack the natural resources needed to rebuild an industrialized society", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3fbsv1", "selftext": "There is a very interesting theory I've read about recently which discusses humanity's capacity to rebuild after an apocalypse and support any sort of industrialization a second time around.  A very in-depth discussion is available in this article \n\nhttp://aeon.co/magazine/technology/could-we-reboot-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels/\n\nSo, let's assume the world collapses, through some terrible tragedy.  For the sake of argument it doesn't really matter if it is nuclear war, or plague, a zombie outbreak, or whatever.  Let's simply assume that its devastating enough that 99% of humanity is gone, and society completely collapses.  Humanity has basically hit a reset button, and except for some ruins lying around the world, we are back in the stone age.  Eventually, we'll assume that society begins to rebuild.  First as small communities, and then eventually into larger and larger cities/states like we've seen in past human history.   \n\nHowever, if we wanted to replicate our modern society, we simply wouldn't have the natural resources necessary to do so.  The basic theory is that due to our current use of fossil fuels, we've mined or extracted all the easily accessible fossil fuels that would be needed by an early industrializing society.  Almost all of the easily accessible coal, oil and other fuels are simply not available.  The remaining sources that are available require complex engineering that would likely not be available in early stages of industrialization.  And while renewable sources of energy, such as wind and water are available, they lack some of the benefits that fossil fuels bring.  The basic argument is that in order for a society to industrialize, it needs a source of relatively cheap, easily accessible energy, and that really only comes from fossil fuels in a pre-industrial society.  Renewable energy is really only feasible much further down the technology development curve.\n\n\nFor the sake of clarity, let's assume that reindustrialization is the goal.  Ultimately, we want to be able to colonize another planet.  I understand humanity could simply go back to living more in tune with nature, but for this discussion, lets assume that the goal is the longer term survival of the species by moving to another planet.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for coupes other than they look cool or may be easier to park in places you wouldn't want to be driving anyways.\n\nEconomy coupes used to be a budget choice for younger people who didn't need the space, so auto companies can also save money on two doors. Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamics/lower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price.\n\n \nAutomatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers \"manual shifting\" anyways. \n\nI believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more.\n\nThis leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe:\n\nHigh end 400-500+ HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference.\n\nAnd for manual transmission:\n\nOld classic imitation cars for the nostalgia?

{"title": "CMV: Sex in public should be legal.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3fb45h", "selftext": "Specifically, people should not be *legally* punished for enjoying themselves through sexual activity in a public place (governmentally operated), like a park or a beach. This activity should be treated by the state as any other public activity, like having a family picnic, a pickup basketball game, or tanning in the sun, and be liable to the same restrictions. That is, sex on a public highway would be unreasonable just as having a picnic on a highway would. Again, in the same grain, this applies to purely public land, not private areas, like businesses (unless they allow such activities). Finally, this is in the context of the United States, but could probably be extended to other countries.\n\nThere are a number of reasons which some might oppose this, so lets preemptively address some of them:\n\n* **Sex is a safety hazard to others.** This is one of the more legitimate points. Full public nudity is opposed for the same reasons; people could reasonably not want to sit in the buttsweat of someone on a bus. However, this would apply to beaches and parks, where clothing is already very optional and the environment is assumed to be unclean (as opposed to a semi-sanitary bus seat). Furthermore, similarly risky activities are allowed in public places, like pickup football, or parties where litter affects others.\n* **People don't want to see it.** Public spaces are generally viewed as areas where freedom should abound- restrictions on speech and assembly are looked down on. For instance, an 'unattractive' person is not *legally* disallowed from a beach, even though some might not want to see that person.\n* **It promotes STDs.** Telling people that they can't have sex is an infringement on personal freedoms, and as long as the sex does no harm to others, that basic human desire should not be impeded.\n* **Casual sex is morally wrong.** If casual sex is morally wrong from a religious perspective, then seperation of church and state should apply to public recreation areas. If sex is morally wrong from a secular view (like theft), then I would need to see a convincing argument that justifies this stance.\n* **Children should not see sex.** Sex is a activity innate to humans and animals alike, and as such should be considered a part of life that everyone should be exposed to. Certainly, children should be guided to mitigate risks (physical and emotional) involved with sex, which we currently do with sex education, but sex itself should not be seen as something harmful to a child.\n\nI'm open to criticism about any of these points, but for now sex seems like it should be legally treated as any other activity in a public area. CMV.\n\n_____\n\n**EDIT :**\n\nI've heard a lot of interesting points today, which is great for a Fresh Topic Friday! Unfortunately, none have been strong enough so far to change my view.

After talking with a few people and looking up some sources, it seems that [current harassment laws are underwhelming at times](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/10/upskirt-photos-legal-dc_n_5966406.html).

{"title": "CMV: Math should not segregate students of different skill levels by placing an adept student into the next year's class. Instead, advanced students should be placed in a rigorous class that uses the same concepts in their peers but in more unconventional and challenging ways.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3faz00", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am only well versed with the math system in the USA.\n\nIn the contemporary classroom, math is an integral class to any student's curriculum. Students are all required to take math for nearly every year. The teacher usually teaches just the concepts in these normal classes. Some students score much higher on these conceptual tests administrated to the class than others. When this consistently happens, the school opts to place the student in a so-called advanced math class, in which they learn material in advance and at a faster pace than their peers. For example, those who demonstrate exceptional ability in 6th grade can skip to Algebra 1 if they pass a ~~national~~ standardized placement test. Supposedly, the schools have demonstrated that they have accomodated the student's needs for a more rigorous class. However, I believe that they have instead wasted the potential of the student's ability because the student never is allowed to expand and extrapolate from the concepts they are taught.\n\nWhen we examine the student who skips to Calculus in year 10 when their peers are learning Geometry, we can see that both the advanced student and the regular students are learning math at the same depth. The Calculus student is supposedly more advanced simply because they have learned more content. However, when we consider that the advanced student has taken summer classes which claim to teach a year's worth of math in 8 weeks, one must then question how the adept has demonstrated their true mastery of the material. Most classes in the USA are little more than plug and chug classes. Algebra 1 teaches students how to make linear and quadratic functions, but it doesn't teach the context behind why they're used. Geometry, which supposedly emphasizes proofs and thinking beyond plug and chug, presents its questions in a straightforward manner. The diagrams are simple enough to \"eyeball\" the answer before one even starts the proof. Algebra 2 is a mashup of so many random concepts, like exponentials and logarithms, polynomials, sequences and series, and matrices, but it doesn't teach amything about why we have those functions and why we use those functions. We don't learn in Algebra 2 that logs were used to represent numbers of greater magnitude than what is comprehendable, nor are we taught about the ability for sequences and series to approximate a value. Trigonometry only teaches us how we can graph a sinusoid and how to use the Law of Sines. It doesn't teach us how we can use sinusoids to represent harmonic motion, nor does it teach how people rearranged the Pythagorean theorem to create a more convenient rule for different scenarios. The school only teaches surface level content to its students, creating a math foundation which is a mile wide, but only a millimeter deep.\n\nEven in differential calculus, students are usually only taught a.) what the derivative is, b.) how to differentiate this long equation, and c.) how to maximize/minimize the function. They aren't taught the true potential and the true challenge of using calculus, and why people created calculus in the first place. For example, while most may know how to maximize the volume of a box, they most likely won't know how to find mutual tangent lines of two quadratic equations. The second task requires understanding of not only what the derivative is, but also requires one to know how to combine the concepts of two points on a linear equation and the how having two different parabolas will affect the model/setup used. What is the point of learning faster if a.) the slower peers will reach the same amount of understanding as you and b.) you will run out of so-called harder and more advanced classes?\n\nSome schools claim that their honors classes solve this problem entirely. They claim that with their honors class comes a chance to view material in \"greater depth\". From my observations (feel free to post counterexamples), I see the schools just jamming more surface level content into their classes. Algebra 2 Honors simply adds conics and asks the students to transform the rectangular equations. They are never taught about how conics begin with parametrics and then transform into rectangular equations. Precalculus Honors simply covers limits (and in some places, simple derivatives) without really expanding on said concepts. What I don't understand is why these schools don't spend more time on developing mastery and context to each concept.\n\nMath, after all, is about understanding patterns of numbers. It's not about simply plug and chug. We don't do harder math by saying \"99x99 is easier than 999x999, which is easier than 9999x9999, therefore we should teach the advanced to do 9999x9999\", we ask ourselves why the answers of those multiplications creates a pattern of 9801, 998001, and 99980001. It's a shame that this kind of teaching is what's driving some people away from math. To them, it's simply busywork, because no teacher provides a challenge which requires much forethought to answer.\n\nCMV?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think in terms of actually being useful to users, it would be nice to have some kind of flagging system for this. My main gripe is that all these sites just show you faces and user names, and you don't really know that these people aren't interested until you've already been drawn in.*\n___\n*This is based on my experience over about 4-6 months of casually using Tinder and OkC, if that helps you form any counter arguments or gives any perspective. Also, this isnt about poly relationships looking for another partner, the scope of my view doesn't even approach that.*\n\nSomething I've noticed with slightly surprising frequency on dating sites are profiles that have one of the following kinds of statements- \"Looking for friends, no commitments.\", \"My husband/boyfriend knows I have this to make friends, and I'm not going to cheat so don't bother\", \"I just moved here and thought this would be a good way to make some friends\", \"I don't take this seriously, I'm just here for the laughs, really not looking for a relationship\" ... etc...\n\nPersonally, I feel these kinds of profiles don't belong on dating sites, and only serve to come off as disingenuous or disappointing. Most dating sites just give you a series of profile pictures and names, and you choose which ones you find attractive to open up and read. The image draws you in, and then the \"Just for friends\" lets you down. To me, this is like someone attending a speed dating night at a singles bar, someone finds them very attractive and wants to see about striking up a relationship, and then they say \"Oh I only came here to maybe find some friends and enjoy people trying too hard\". If you're really looking for friends, there are places designed for platonic relationships- in the context of online communities there's places like subreddits for local towns, there's meetup.com, there's plenty of public Facebook groups for all kinds of interests, etc... \n\nGoing to a place specifically marketed to and called a dating app is just disingenuous. I wouldn't go to Ashley Madison if I just wanted to get a platonic shoe shopping buddy. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: With the possible exception of the GBA incarnation, Mario Kart 64 was the worst iteration of the series.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3faonv", "selftext": "Necessary context: I am not old enough to have grown up with Mario Kart 64. The first console I ever owned (aside from my Game Boy Color) was a GameCube, and the first game I got for the system, aside from MVP Baseball '04, was Mario Kart: Double Dash. I've played the crap out of the GC, DS, Wii, and 3DS versions of the game, and have touched every other version to some extent (I own the GBA and N64 versions and play MK8 with my friend who owns a Wii U relatively often).\n\nHear me out on this one. I think Mario Kart 64 was the worst game in the series for a few reasons, some of which I'll outline here:\n\n**Course design.** With a few exceptions (Choco Mountain and Yoshi Valley, for example), I think the courses in MK64 are the most boring courses in the Mario Kart Series by far, not counting SNES and GBA. And while it's easy to make the case that course design steadily improved with each game as more material became available and more memory was available to devote to each course, I think that the courses in MK64, SNES MK, and GBA MK were significantly, significantly worse than any of the other games' courses. The courses in these games are often flat and uninteresting, not particularly dynamic in terms of interesting turns or bits of track, and (especially with MK64) far too long. I think it's possible to have relatively gimmick-light courses which are still exceptionally fun (courses like the DS' DK Pass and the Gamecube's Dry Dry Desert did this very well), and I think that most of the N64's courses failed to accomplish this - they were largely dull, slow courses which were too large and monotonous to stand up very well. (And no, being able to skip half of Rainbow Road very much does not make that course any less of an absolute slog.) It has some of my least favorite courses in any Mario Kart game - Toad's Turnpike, Moo Moo Farm, and Rainbow Road are some of the worst MK courses I've played. I'm willing to give the SNES a pass for poor course design given exceedingly limited memory and the fact that it was one of the first games to really play with 3D in such a revolutionary way (as well as the fact that it, well, started the franchise, and therefore was allowed to have prototype bugs). I'm also willing to give the GBA version somewhat of a pass, given that it was the first mobile title and was on a tiny screen, though I also really don't like the course design there. But the N64 version? Not so much. The differences between the courses in the N64 and Gamecube games is so staggering that it's tough to give the former as much of a pass.\n\n**Graphics.** Call me crazy, but I liked the SNES game's graphics a lot more than those of the N64's version. The N64 had some absolutely beautiful games for the time - Mario 64, Majora's Mask, and Banjo-Kazooie are all phenomenal-looking games. Compared to those, MK64 is flat-out ugly. The character models are very blocky and way too angular, the trails behind shells look gross, and the \"POOMP\" effects are really, for lack of a better term, \"immersion-breaking.\" Especially compared to the very clean graphics of the previous console's incarnation (SNES) and the beautiful graphics of the next version (DD), MK64's graphics are particularly egregious.\n\n**Rubber-banding.** It's bad in all Mario Kart games, but it's especially flagrant in MK64. In no other MK game I've played have I held a commanding lead and then literally seen second place *teleport* right behind me. They don't even do it the justice of speeding the player up - Wario or Peach or whoever will literally fade away and reform right behind me. I'm fine with rubber-banding (or more tolerant of, at least) as long as it's \"believable,\" and MK64's rubber-banding is one hundred percent not that.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only thing MK64 really has going for it is its four-player multiplayer. This is huge, sure, but it would have probably come anyway - the SNES already had two-player multiplayer, and giving a game a pass just because four players can play it together doesn't mean all that much. Plus, I'd argue that pretty much every other game's multiplayer was better - what with online modes in almost every later incarnation and better balancing for all four players and some of the best battle modes we've seen yet in Double Dash and Funky Stadium in Wii, I'd argue that 64 was good multiplayer-wise but not good enough to elevate it above any of the other games (with the exception of the GBA edition, whose multiplayer was naturally near-impossible to implement).\n\nSo, CMV. I assume many of y'all feel pretty passionately about the quality of MK64, so this should shape up to be an interesting thread!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Women are inferior to men in most aspects of life.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3fa3pf", "selftext": "I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say.  Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.\n\nMy main points:\n\n1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. \n\n2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) \n\n3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. \n\nThese reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This is also exactly why I don't see the need for assault weaponry to be made available to the public.\n\nI am not a major gun enthusiast by any means, but I have shot plenty of guns on multiple occasions and it's a total blast. \n\nI fully support people owning hunting rifles, shotguns, and even handguns to a degree (they also seem unnecessary to me but that's a whole different topic so I'll keep them on the table for the sake of this CMV). My line kind of ends there though. I don't think there is any practical reason outside of \"it's my hobby and I think it's cool\" for anyone who isn't regularly in combat situations to have access to assault rifles, missiles, mortars, or anything that is designed to kill soldiers, policemen, or enemy combatants.\n\nTL;DR: The only argument I've heard in favor of civilian ownership of assault weaponry is that we need to be able to protect ourselves from tyranny. I posit that you would need a lot more than assault weaponry to defend against the government, and that unless you are in favor of civilians being able to purchase surface-to-air missiles, that's not a real argument.\n\nCMV.\n\nEDIT 1: I've been called out multiple times for incorrectly identifying an AR-15 as an assault weapon and don't know enough about that specific weapon to have a say. So! Please forgive my ignorance and let's change the focus from AR-15 to \"weapon designed primarily for shooting soldiers, policemen, or enemy combatants in combat situations\". I apologize for mis-representing the AR-15.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm done. I'm getting beat up pretty badly over my failure to properly define \"assault weaponry\". I'm certainly not an arms expert, but 75% of this CMV have been people arguing with me over semantics instead of addressing my point. You guys know way more about the specifics of what makes an AR-15 an assault rifle or not, but my main point is that there are things that are legal for civilians to buy that have no practical use outside of military conflict, and I think that it's just as silly to argue in favor of armor piercing rounds as it is for SAMs.\n\nTo everyone who contributed to that conversation, I thank you for your time and responses. While my V wasn't necessarily C'd, it was informative for me to read your positions and I was able to see the issue from a couple of new angles. Thank you.\n\nTo everyone else, I thank you for the realization that I have way less of an idea about what constitutes assault weaponry than I previously thought I did. It wasn't really to my point, but I thank you for your input, and after reading some of your responses I can see that it must be infuriating to have people who don't really know what they're talking about come and weigh in on something that you are knowledgable and passionate about. I apologize for being one of those guys, and will keep it in mind and avoid it in the future.\n\nThanks again, everyone.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I believe that domestic labor has value, and the principles behind alimony laws are valid.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3f7g2o", "selftext": "Working in family law, I meet a lot of men facing divorce who feel no obligation to support their ex.  You also hear a lot of mens rights activists bemoan the concept of alimony as unjust.  They usually cite statistics showing how often men are the ones disproportionately ordered to pay support.\n\nI don't give much merit to these claims.  What most of these men don't understand is that marriage in the eyes of the law is primarily an economic partnership.  When a couple marries, they voluntarily agree to equally share resources produced during the marriage.  \n\nThe traditional view of marriage has the wife contribute via domestic labor, i.e. cooking, cleaning, childcare, etc.  First off, I think it is important to realize that this labor has real economic value.  These tasks need to be done in order for either spouse to succeed in another professional setting.  \n\nThe counter argument you often hear from divorced men is that their wives refused to work, and also refused to perform these domestic duties, and thus should not be entitled to support.  While this may not seem fair, the reality is that this outcome is still produced by the man's *choice* to marry someone with no professional prospects, and no willingness to perform domestic duties.  In other words, the man.entered into a bad economic partnership and must now shoulder the costs.\n\nIn many cases, whether the man realizes it or not, there was a reason why they chose to marry who they did.  Maybe it wasn't directly economic, maybe it was for sexual attraction, emotional support, or social status.  I would argue that even these factors have economic value, even if it is difficult to quantify.  When you develop a career, you pour your soul into your work, and everything about your lifestyle affects your success.  So regardless of whether the individual got what they thought they would from their spouse, their spouse still had an inexorable affect on their career and thus has earned a stake in it.  I think this is fundamentally fair, in my opinion.  \n\nFinally, I want to point out that there is a distinction between temporary and permanent spousal support.  Temporary support is usually close to a 50%, flat calculation intended to maintain the parties lifestyle until permanent support is determined.  Permanent support is always a lower amount, intended to provide the supported party enough time to become self-sufficient through education, job training, etc.  In longer marriages, there might not be a termination date, for example if the spouse is close to retirement or the relationship lasted so long that a permanent stake in the others career is warranted...but in most cases, there is a termination date involved.\n\nI can concede that it is more than possible for men to become subject to unfair rulings.  However, I don't think unfair outcomes necessarily reflect unfair principles.  Usually, when something unfair happens it is because the case was not handled properly by the parties or the Judge; this is not the fault of the laws themselves, or the principles behind them."}

{"title": "CMV: Constitutional \"originalist\" interpretation of the Eighth Amendment cannot justify taking inflation into account, and thus any bail or fine that the Framers and/or Americans in general would have considered excessive in 1791 should be considered unconstitutional by originalists.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3f73cy", "selftext": "Originalism is a constitutional interpretive doctrine in which one reads the provisions of the Constitution to retain the meaning that they had when they were originally adopted.  Thus, an originalist (such as Justice Scalia) would say that if the First Amendment was not understood to prohibit public school prayer in 1791, it should not do so today; and if the Fourteenth Amendment was not understood to guarantee a right to same-sex marriage in 1868, it should not do so today.  The rationale for this is that the people, through their representatives, only actually properly ratified those original meanings, so those are the only meanings that should be considered law.  I take no position, in this post, on the correctness of this general originalist philosophy or its underlying justification, except that at the very least I don't think it's blatantly *un*-reasonable.\n\nIn interviews and concurrences/dissents, Scalia often brings up the Eighth Amendment in explaining his philosophy, and his frustration with the idea that current Supreme Court precedent applies the \"evolving standards of decency\" test, which he passionately opposes. As I understand it, the standard originalist argument against the extension of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment to, say, the death penalty, goes something like this:\n\n* The people adopted the Eighth Amendment in 1791, and thus forbade \"cruel and unusual punishments\".  \n* Another amendment (the Fifth) adopted at the same time specified some rights of a defendant charged with a capital offense.  Captial offense means one you can be executed for.\n* Moreover, they kept on executing felons afterwards, and no one really thought this was incompatible with the Bill of Rights they had just passed.\n* Thus, the Eighth Amendment can't possibly prohibit the death penalty.\n\nOf course, this is entirely correct, assuming principles of originalism.  So, thus, the originalist-interpreted Eighth Amendment prohibits only those punishments that were considered \"cruel and unusual\" in 1791.\n\nNow, I think it has to go the other way, too.  So if, hypothetically, the modern government wanted to torture someone as punishment, I think any originalist would have to call that unconstitutional as well, even if there was popular support for it, since that was clearly one of the things the Eighth Amendment proscribed when it was adopted.  \n\nSo, it seems to me that the proper originalist reading of the Eighth Amendment is one where it prohibits some discrete set of punishments (such as those involving torture), a set whose elements are defined as those punishments that the Framers and/or American society would have found \"cruel and unusual\" (compared to the crime) in 1791, and that set cannot ever change, regardless of how society or the Supreme Court or anything else changes.  Nothing can be added to or removed from that set without a Constitutional amendment.  \n\nFine.  But what basis is there, then, for not using the same rule when interpreting the *other* provisions of the Eighth Amendment?  If the same logic is used, the Excessive Bail and Excessive Fines clauses should be interpreted as forbidding a discrete set of bail amounts and fines (paired with certain crimes) that were considered \"excessive\" by the Framers and/or American society in 1791.  **And that set can never change, regardless of how society or the Supreme Court or anything else changes.**\n\nI can't think of any reason why inflation, which I think can be fairly described as \"evolving standards of currency\", should be seen as fundamentally different from the same \"evolving standards of decency\" factor that Scalia and other originalists object to so strongly.  During oral argument in *Hollingsworth v. Perry*, Scalia asked the respondents' attorney when prohibiting same-sex marriage became unconstitutional.  Scalia's own answer to that, of course, would be \"not in 1868, obviously, which means never\".  In that same vein, though, when did it *cease* to be unconstitutional to set bail at $1 million, which would surely have been considered ludicrously excessive for *any* bailable offense in 1791?\n\nI don't think most originalists actually hold this view, but I really don't see a principled reason why not, and so as a result, this is my view.  That said, I honestly do believe there likely is such a reason, and that I just haven't thought of it.  So, CMV."}

{"title": "CMV: Apple makes the best laptops on the market", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3f6qmi", "selftext": "A little bit of background.  I haven't owned any Apple products until very recently, a little over two months ago, when I got a macbook pro as a new laptop.  I had a windows xp machine that died on me quite some time ago, got a chromebook, and have been using my desktop since, with an android tablet for mobile computing.  After much consideration, and reading, I decided on the computer that I am typing this post on, a 15\" Macbook Pro.  I have used other people's computers in passing, and have tried other laptops, and while I am not a laptop connoisseur, I think that this is the best computer I have ever bought or used.  Here are a list of some of the reasons.\n\nIt is really fast, 10 second start ups, and fast load times for everything.\n\nIt is well engineered, well weighted, and has a whole bunch of really nice features in the machine itself.  The small rubber feet keep the machine in place without pretruding out from it too much, the ports are well placed, the charging cable is great, the magnetic attachment is wonderful.  The battery life is really good, when I am not running much on it, I can get 10 to 15 hours of battery life.  The keyboard is fantastic, well spaced, and has a nice clicking feel.  The screen is nice and bright and text is sharp and clear.  And it does a great job of managing heat.  This is all just the hardware.  On the software side, Mac OS X blows Windows out of the water (My desktop runs Windows 7)  I really like the finder, the tabs and different options for sorting files and viewing media are really good.  Safari is actually useable, the Mail app is one of the best email programs I have ever used, and is one of my favorite programs.  And the iWork suite is really nice, well designed optimized.  I actually prefer the menu bars in Mac OS X, and the full screen options make focusing on work easy.  The interface isn't cluttered, or overly colorful.  Even the packaging is great, simple easy to pull apart, and well laid out.  The function keys have a legitimate function in all applications.  And so on, and so on.  I am not a huge Apple fan or supporter, I really don't like the iMac's \"magic mouse, or the iPad or iPhone, I like operating systems I can tinker with a bit.  This machine strikes a nice balance between ease of use and power computing.  Are there any better windows laptops than the Macbook Pro for general computing?  I would like to hear of them.  Also, I have found a fantastic writing app that is mac only, called Ulysses.  It is the best creative writing app I have used on any computer.\n\nedit:  Something I should add to the discussion is that price does not concern me.  It would like examples of laptop PCs with comparable built quality, battery life, and performance to a Mac.  Let's keep this discussion going.\n\nedit to my edit:  I am not a gamer.  I don't play many games, so this does not concern me.  Perhaps a better title would have been \"I think that Apple makes the best laptop computers on the market\", but it is too late now.\n\nedit 3: Completely unrelated to this post, I got this fantastic kettle corn at the farmer's market today, great (if unhealthy) snack for redditing.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For that matter, I haven't heard anyone of any race say they would rather have been born any other race or even their own. \n\nI recently read an interview with Ta-nehisi Coats where he was the beauty of black people. \n\nInterviewer: Speaking of beauty, and seeing things for the fullness of what they are, early on in the book you talk about your time at Howard, and how you discovered the majesty of black people while on the Yard. Can you talk more about your time there, and how it shaped your years after that?\n\nCoats: I grew up around black people, but I didn\u2019t grow up around black people like that. Howard pulls from the entire black diaspora. And black people, being human beings first and foremost, there is a great variation among them. And to see all that variation united under one thing, and yet still be individuals\u2014I had never seen anything like that. It gave me a great respect for how full the black experience really was. How much it really meant, and how big it was. Somebody once told me, black people, in and of themselves, are cosmopolitan. There\u2019s cosmopolitanism within the black experience. There\u2019s an incredible amount. It\u2019s an incredible thing, and I first saw that at Howard.\n\nI thought this was a particularly moving explanation of his black experience. He doesn't appear to have any regrets for being born black and appears to be proud of who he is and the racial and ethnic culture he was born and raise in. \n\nThat being said, people who say that they would rather be born white, I think it diminishes those who are born black and can be restated as \"white is better than black so I would choose to be white.\""}

Multiple references to Brady's preferences of the PSI of game balls and of providing a needle for use.\n\n3. In the context of an exchange about the pressure of game balls, one said to the other that Brady \"actually brought you up and said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done.\" Mcnally's only assigned responsibility regarding game balls was to deliver them.

Even though the phone was talked about in the investigation, he failed to tell them this until several weeks later. Brady says it is what he does with old phones when he gets a new one, but he gave NFL investigators an older phone before that. He was told his own lawyer could select the communications off his personal cellphone that were of interest to the league and send them those specific records, so the excuse of his personal privacy is irrelevant.

{"title": "CMV: Speedos (briefs) are by far superior swimming trunks", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3f4hug", "selftext": "We're getting into summer here so I've been swimming more. I think speedos (ie brief trunks) are by far the best kind of trunks to wear in the pool. But I gather that in America speedos are pretty lowly regarded except by competitive swimmers. I challenge you to persuade me speedos aren't superior.\n\nHere are my main reasons:\n\n**Cheaper**\n\nThey use less material so they are obviously cheaper than other options (like jammers, those trunks like cycling shorts).\n\n**Lighter**\n\nDon't weigh down your bag, especially when wet.\n\n**Less Bulky**\n\nRelated to the previous point but still worth mentioning in its own right. I can fit a pair of speedos in my bag and barely know they're there. I can roll them up with my magic towel and still fit the magic towel back into its plastic tube.\n\n**Dry Faster**\n\nSpeedos dry super fast and because there isn't much material they don't carry much water anyway. After swimming and a quick buzz in the spinning trunk dryer I can put my speedos in a bag with a book.\n\n**Help You Swim Faster**\n\nSpeedos cause way less drag than board shorts. It's true that the full-body suits can improve speed even more but not significantly unless you're a top pro--and the cost is prohibitive.\n\n**Help You Swim Better**\n\nDrag from board shorts lowers your legs in the water causing poor body position. This has a negative effect on technique.\n\n**Cleaner**\n\nPeople often wear board shorts on the beach and get sand in their pockets. When they swim in the pool the sand comes out and collects on the bottom of the pool. One pool I go to has this problem really badly. There's always sand in the pool. It's also skank when people walk around in their sweaty shorts all day in the summer and then wear them into the pool. (This is one of the main reasons speedos are comulsory in French swimming pools.)\n\n**Funky Tanline**\n\nIf you swim in an outdoor pool.\n\n**Feel Better in Water**\n\nBoard shorts waft around in the water and don't feel as good. You have much less restricted movement in speedos.\n\n**Good for Body Image**\n\nThe main reason people don't wear speedos in my experience is because they are embarrassed about their image/don't feel comfortable in them. I think that's really sad. Where I grew up speedos were compulsory and no one gave a toss because they were used to it. I think that's a much better attitude to have.\n\nTo be honest, given all these points I don't know why anyone would want ever want to wear board shorts. I challenge you to persuade me speedos aren't superior!\n\n(BTW I'm not arguing that speedos are better on the beach. I happen to think they are but I realise the fashion qualities of boardies may be more significant on the beach/when you aren't actually somewhere to swim.)\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Many have said its focus on reasoning versus knowledge had a negative effect on college admissions.  Reasons like it favored those of higher income backgrounds and whatnot.\n\nHowever, I think it makes sense to have a reasoning test available to students.  The ACT is an achievement test.  It is available to assess knowledge.  A students grades in their classes also demonstrate what they have learned.  Now, with the test change, there will be nothing to assess reasoning abilities.  If a student is truly at a disadvantage because of their background they are able to take the other test.  Providing a different kind of test allows students to play to their strength.\n\nAnd the only argument I hear against it, that it favors economically advantaged students, doesn't make sense.  Economically advantaged students are going to benefit with any test.  They have access to more resources that can either help with their thinking process or with their knowledge base.  A reasoning test allows a disadvantaged students to actually stand out if their school was sub par in terms of teaching, but the student had good reasoning abilities.\n\nSorry if this is formatted weirdly, I'm on mobile.  And if this doesn't make sense it's for the same reason."}

Rather, the requirement that they must have a solution when they have neither the expertise or power to do so is a sure way to make sure that workers are discouraged from communicating openly with management which will create a rift between layers in a workplace."}
{"title": "CMV: Those who condemn the hunting of trophy animals and are not vegetarians are hypocrites", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3f3rb7", "selftext": "Tonight's front page of r/all, as well as headlines on many other news sites, are dominated by content related to the hunting of \"trophy\" animals, sparked by the killing of Cecil the lion. Although admittedly it is far from a consensus, many seem to believe that the hunting of these exotic animals is objectively wrong and therefore should be prohibited. It is likely that many of those vocal with their distaste of hunting for sport (like ***[the &gt;500,000 signatories of the \"Justice for Cecil\" petition](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/821/738/351/demand-justice-for-cecil-the-lion-in-zimbambwe/)*** ) however are also consumers of meat. I believe this can be inferred by the sheer amount of negative press Walter Palmer is receiving contrasted with the fact that a minority of people are vegetarians. This perspective seems hypocritical. \n\nI can imagine two main counterarguments to my claim. Their general ideas, with my responses, are below: \n\n1) \"The killing of endangered animals is worse than the killing of animals under no danger of extinction.\"\nResponse: Objectively I do not think an individual life can and should be valued more than another. Therefore although killing a member of an endangered species is deplorable, due to the smaller room for error for the management of the populations of these species, the killing of an animal like a cow is equally so.\n\n2) \"Killing for sport is unjustifiable whereas killing animals for their meat/pelt/whatever serves a purpose, making it justifiable.\"\nResponse: It is no longer true that humans, at least those in developed areas, need the goods of a dead animal to survive. Although it could be argued that at one point the hunting of animals was a necessary evil for the survival of our species, there is no longer any need to murder animals for sustenance. All of the nutrients necessary for the well-being of humans that are gained from eating meat now have more ethical alternatives. \n\nI'd appreciate if anyone could either further develop one of the perspectives presented above or share a new one.

For the purposes of this CMV, I'm assuming this phenomenon is at least semi-accurate for most of the population. I am also assuming we live in a society that is based around the sleep patterns of morning people.\n\nHowever, my view is that society would be better off if it catered to so-called \"Night-owls\". Night owls are shown to be more intelligent, more personable, and more productive than morning people. [However, there is empirical evidence that they suffer from a kind of \"social jet-lag\" that results in less happiness, less white matter in the brain, and more self-reports of feeling tired](http://www.medicaldaily.com/night-owls-smarter-new-study-suggests-late-bed-late-rise-leads-greater-workplace-success-244753).\n\nMy hypothesis is that Night owls show increased aptitude *despite* suffering through unfavorable conditions. If presented with favorable conditions, such as a societal system of late-to-bed, late-to-rise, we would see an even more pronounced productivity and success from these people, which would benefit society as a whole.\n\nWe no longer live in a strictly agrarian society. \"Business Hours\" as they stand are arbitrary, and in an increasingly international business world, strict hours become even less reasonable. We have lived under the tyranny of morning people for too long. Their antiquated and inefficient system must be abolished. Long Live the Night Owl. Long Live the New Flesh.

I don't think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues.

That to fight racism, we need to *debate* racism *with* the racists. I think this line of thinking is naive, and simply wrong, for these reasons:  \n\n1) There is mountains of scientific evidence that climate change exists (and is a result of human activities) and there is also mountains of evidence of the efficacy of vaccines. No serious, respected group of scientists deny this. Yet, the way the media has addressed these topics (which is to give \"both sides\" of the \"debate\" an equal platform/time) has *not* resulted in these positions declining in belief among the general public. [The BBC has just recognized this](http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/bbc_staff_ordered_to_stop_giving_equal_air_time_to_climate_deniers/), a bit late though. The anti-vaxxer movement is going strong, and has grown thanks to many \"debates\" being put on air. There are *politicians in the U.S. Congress* who don't believe in climate change. Open debate does not help to weed out such positions, clearly. \n\n2) While I can't say how effective \"silencing the opposition\" is, I disagree with the idea what \"not giving them a platform\" is the same thing as silencing. Nobody is stopping them from shouting what they have to say over the Internet in their blogs and websites. What shouldn't happen is pretending giving them the respect of an open debate and claiming that both sides have merit. You wouldn't bring on a KKK member to argue with a civil rights activist on TV, why should reddit?\n\n3) reddit as a platform itself is very ill-suited to the style of \"open debate\" that /u/spez and his supporters claim will be enough to weed out the racism in society. The upvote/downvote system and the userbase's affinity for liking long arguments that sound logical and scientific is perfect fodder for the white supremacist's style of argumentation, which is basically a Gish Gallop. You inundate your opponent with a bunch of links and cherry-picked facts to *strongly suggest but never outright state* a conclusion (that black people are inferior) which leaves you a lot of lee-way with claiming victory over your debate opponent. Plus, the general disdain for any explanation that deals with \"SJW\" terms and explanations makes it harder for anyone to side with you. The white supremacists come to the debate with the intention to *win* an argument, *not* to debate. So unless you're equally as prepared with your own walls-of-text copypasted, you'll lose unless you have the hours (and the brigade of supporters) to deal with them.\n\n4) As an addendum to #1 and #3, given how the issue of race and biology, sociology, etc. are still not nearly as understood as how vaccines are necessary and how climate change is happening, giving them an equal platform gives them an even better shot than the anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers in converting people to their ideology. Dylann Storm Roof became a racist after he looked into intentionally misleading copypasta of black crime statistics posted by the Council of Conservative Citizens. And you can see where that led him.\n\nI think for these reasons that /u/spez's reason for not banning a place like /r/coontown is naive and possibly dangerous.  \n\n---  \n\nThat being said, I'm not exactly sure *what* the right way to combat ignorance and hate is. Better education in our public schools would probably be a good first step.  \n\nAlternatively, we could follow the example in the story of [the Racist Tree](http://lardcave.net/text/the_racist_tree.html).\n"}

This would solve international conflicts (ex. Oil in the middle east and it's effect on the global economy)\n**Argument:** Not every country have the resources to gain complete energy independence. It might be a lack of rivers to install hydro, a geographical location that does not get enough sun for solar, a lack of forests for biomass or just lack of coal or oil. Nuclear energy can utilize Thorium which is so common we literally have tons of it laying around and it is found in most rocks all around the world.\n2. **Time frame** It's theoretically possible to have 100% renewable energy production (ex. solar, wind, hydro) but to reach 100% and to meet the growing demand of energy in the world is extremely difficult and requires multiple technological discoveries that can revolutionize energy production and storage (batteries, nano-tech materials (graphene?), fusion energy). I think we should invest in these technologies but we will realistically never reach 100% renewable within this century, and we don't have enough time [insert generic global warming argument here].\n3. **Nuclear is OK** If an alien lands in a jungle and gets bitten by a venomous snake he/she might think that all animals are bad. But we all know the alien is wrong, sure snakes might be bad but what about kittens? The same principle goes for nuclear. Just because Fukushima blows up (uranium light water reactor) doesn't mean that all nuclear reactors are bad. There are hundreds of models and the ones of the forth generation (ex, thorium, LFTR) simply cannot blow up and are walk-away safe. The little waste material produced emits alpha rays that can't penetrate your skin. It also has an half-life of 300 years (the waste produced today has an half-life of over 200000 years) and this waste cannot be used in nuclear weapons. **To summarize the nuclear-is-ok argument** Generation III = bad (uranium, gamma emitting and long-lived waste, nukes, extreme pressure hydrogen explosions (Fukushima)) Generation IV = good (Thorium, alpha emitting short-lived waste, walk-away safe, 100% nuke-free) The thorium technology is old and simple. Some models still needs improvement but this is just a question of funding and money (no sci-fi technology involved)\n\nWhat's holding nuclear back is lack of funding (why fund scientist to invent better reactors when we can dig up coal instead?) and an unhealthy view on nuclear technology produced by carrier-politicians and mass-media (ask a scientist or an engineer and the majority will probably be pro or neutral to nuclear technology)\n\nEnglish might not be perfect in this rant\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

[Ken White at Popehat describes how:](http://popehat.com/2011/12/01/reminder-oh-wont-you-please-shut-up/)\n\n&gt;Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie \u2014 for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You \u2014 having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer \u2014 obligingly lie about this fact.

To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material \u2014 but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government.\n\n&gt;Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works \u2014 even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge \u2014 a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations.\n\nI think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.

Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.\n\n\nAs I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.\n\n\nI can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. \n\n\nHowever, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.\n\n\nI sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.\n\n\nIgnorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).\n\n\nSo to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message.

{"title": "CMV: \"Lockdowns\" should not be the default response to armed intruders in institutions. Lockdowns should not be drilled.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3f1w3o", "selftext": "This post is not about coming up with a solution to individuals engaging in mass violence. This post is about the effectiveness of lockdowns and specifically using a lockdown as the default, go-to solution that should be trained for, and drilled for. I do not believe schools should be drilling lockdowns. Which is basically described as:\n\n* Locking and possibly barricading doors,\n\n* Turning off lights\n\n* Hiding in the corner\n\nI understand why a \"lockdown\" would be the best thing to do in certain circumstances. For example to avoid bottle-necking exits and police are on-scene and when no other options are available.  I don't think it's a good first choice. I view it as a choice of last resort.\n\n**Effectiveness**\n\nThe rationales I've heard for lockdowns look good with a cursory glance but do not stand up when examined rationally in detail. That the ideas and goals behind them have not bared out true in real world cases. Where the assertions involving lockdowns are a series of logical fallacies, like bandwagoning, false cause, special pleading or other logical fallacy. Where basically people want something to be effective and therefore assume that it will be effective, all without looking at evidence if it was effective or not.\n\n**Security Theater**\n\nSomething must be done! Something will be done! Something is being done. Something has been done. All is therefore well and the masses are happy.\n\nI believe lockdowns are more about optics and emotion than about logic, evidence and effectiveness. That drilling for school shootings are the modern equivalent of \"Duck and Cover\" to avoid a nuclear attack. I'm sure that \"Duck and Cover\" could help some with falling debris. But like lockdowns, that's not what it was really about.\n\nDoes anyone honestly think that turning off the lights and being still in a corner is going to help in any meaningful way? It's a human being bent on violence and murder, not a velociraptor that is attracted to movement and does not understand a light switch.\n\n**Doors**\n\nThe first argument I hear is that locked doors slow an attacker down. No matter how strong it is, locking the door is never going to be effective if an attacker has the key. Keys can be acquired in advance or via force from a victim.\nPeople wildly overestimate the amount of time it takes to break down a door especially when the person expects to be breaking down a door. It's seconds. It's not hours, it's not minutes, it's seconds to destroy the kind of door at a school. The types of doors that are effective are the types of doors you find in prisons. \n\nFor example, [Sandy Hook Elementary](http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/12/us/sandy-hook-timeline/?sa=X&amp;ved=0CBYQ9QEwADgUahUKEwjMub3DmIDHAhWIz4AKHWgEB-w#1) was specifically 'hardened' against outside attack. Administrators viewed it as a credible threat and took precautions. There was a security door that required buzz in and the school locked it's doors at 9:30am each day. The attacker in that case destroyed the security door, and broke into two other locked classrooms in order to kill 20 children and 6 adults. The ones in the classrooms were warned via the announcements and followed procedure. Police responded in 2mins 41 seconds and it was over before police could do anything. I don't know what could have been done-- if anything. I do know for certain that 1) locking doors, 2) turning off lights, and 3) hiding in the corner, did absolutely nothing useful. Which should not be surprising since it's not particularly difficult to break down a door.\n\n**Drilling**\n\nDrilling is so that people know what to do. This the part that I object to. Having a plan, sure. Taking precautions, sure. Talking about scenarios, sure. Practicing huddling in fear when someone is at the door-- No.\n\nDrilling one thing beyond all others reinforces it as being the 'right' solution and the one that 'should be' followed. It is a dynamic situation where all options need to be considered and drilling locks into one train of thought. It is harmful in that it is limiting. The correct solution is the one that they go home alive and unhurt. That should be the only thing that matters.\n\n**Knowing is half the battle**\n\nDrilling has another drawback. Odds are it is also going to be teaching attackers how best to find their victims. In most cases of school shootings the perpetrators were students. Knowing how everyone else will respond helps them plan how to do more harm. \n\n**Panic**\n\nA spurious reason I've heard for drilling is that it reduces panic. It's not going to do anything for panic in a real situation. If something does not go according to the drill then it is suddenly an unknown situation. The drill itself is creating a situation where panic is going to set in at the crucial moment.\n\nThe reason why panic is a problem is when someone panics they can freeze. Freezing is bad. However in this case the entire point of the lockdown drill is to teach children to freeze!\n\nDrill every day for a year and it will not matter. Muscle memory is not going to kick in. Nobody is going to know while huddling in the dark if the shots and scream they heard means their best friend is dead. Nobody knows if the person shooting has a key. Nobody knows if their room is going to be next. Nobody knows if they will be saved in time. Sitting in the dark all these things will be the only things they are thinking about. When [a school did an unannounced school shooting drill](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/19/principal-suspended-shooting-drill-jewett-academy-jacquelyn-moore_n_6188418.html) it was terrifying for all involved and the consensus was it was bad idea.\n\n**Meh. I'm sure it is fine.**\n\nKids generally do not take drills seriously. Drills themselves (as opposed to the real event it is simulating) are always kind of silly. Kids will make light of pretty much anything especially something like shooting up their friends. Drilling for anything carries the danger that when it really happens that people assume it is a drill especially for something that is a one in a million chance. \"Meh. I'm sure it's fine.\"\n\n**Triggering harm**\n\nThere are 55 million school children in the USA. About 20 suffer violent deaths on school grounds each year\u2014a 1 in 2.5 million chance. Those are the odds that harm will occur. How many of those deaths would have been prevented by running drills? Compare that to how many of those 55 million school children had a real traumatic event similar to the drill. If all 55 million go through lockdown drills how many kids are going to be triggered and suffer real harm by the fake drill?\n\nDrilling lockdowns wastes time that could be spent educating kids doing an activity of questionable value that is potentially psychologically scaring. Change my view. Make me believe that **drilling** lockdowns is a good idea. I do not believe that lockdowns are a good response to an armed attacker.\n\nNote that I do not have alternative but I do not believe I need to champion something else in order to criticize something I believe is a terrible idea. However the merits of lockdowns is a secondary concern. My primary concern is that actively drilling them causes real harm.\n\nEDIT: I'm being systematically downvoted so I've turned off my inbox and I'm done.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Realistic graphics in video games are no longer amazing - they're boring now and detract from other possible priorities developers can focus on.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3f1kvz", "selftext": "I'm not inherently against realistic games, but resent their ubiquity as well as the fact that they're the top priority.  I see most of the games in the store, and they just don't speak to me.  I enjoyed Brothers A Tale of Two Sons far more than Red Dead Redemption, The Witcher 3 and Skyrim.\n\n1. Games were invented as an abstract expression.  In the NES days, games weren't literal and drawn to scale.  Mario wasn't literally jumping on turtles.  I appreciate games today wanting to add story and human elements, but all games will ever be (in terms of immersion) is an abstraction with more realistic sprites. \n\n2. With realistic graphics, there's little room for imagination now that everything is literally represented.  With games like Doom and The Wind Waker, you could fill in plenty of blanks and make lots of assumptions about where you were.  \n\n3. Realistic games have a short shelf life.  In 3 years, people aren't going to care.  Notice how Bioshock 1 still looks great from an artistic perspective to this day, but Call of Duty Modern Warfare (released the same year) looks ugly.\n\n4. Being wow'ed by realistic graphics is a hedonic treadmill.  When a big graphical leap comes, you're at first amazed at how far video games have come.  Shortly after, it's just another game with good graphics.  Why chase a fleeting moment?\n\n5. We've had too many realistic games in the past 10.  When Crysis and Gears of War came out, they looked amazing.  Now every game looks like that.\n\n6. Current gen consoles aren't a big step up, compared to leaps in previous generations.  Even remasters are starting to push the hardware limits.  Going to 1080p today wasn't nearly as significant as the jump to HD in 2005 or the jump to 3D in 1995.  There's only so much you can do with realism this gen.\n\n7. Realistic graphics usually result in (sports aside) games that are violent.  They're ubiquitous.  Ubisoft has made 11 Assassin Creed games but can't make 1 3D Rayman game.  Sony abandoned Jak for more violent titles.  Violent games aren't inherently bad (I enjoyed games like L.A. Noire and The Last of Us), but don't people get tired of playing the same game over and over?  Don't people get tired of shooting soldiers or beating up zombies all of the time?\n\n8. There are more important priorities.  Story, characters, player reward/motivation systems, depth of mechanics, balance of meta/strategies, unique online/social experiences, user created content sharing and such.\n\n--- \n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the responses.  I'm going to still keep replying.\n\nI was inspired to make this thread by seeing realistic demos of Zelda such as Ocarina's Temple of Time on the Unreal engine or Nintendo's Wii U tech demo.  And I'm not by principle against realistic Zelda.  I'd love to have one when technology can handle it without costs being crazy.  But just because someone looks amazing in a trailer, doesn't mean the game will be anymore amazing than Ocarina of Time's graphics when we actually play it.  It will be something like.  Wow!!!  Zelda looks real!!! ...Now what?\n\n---\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

And, there's no need to deliberately deprive them of all palatable or enjoyable food -- \"you're poor, so you're stigmatized and condemned to subsist off protein gruel\" --  that's not what I'm advocating.\n\nHowever, soda is not food.  It provides no nutritional benefit, and causes plenty of nutritional harms.   While it is theoretically possible to conceive of a \"healthy\" soda, you could surely find the same benefits from other non-soda sources.  Somebody makes a veggie soda?  There are dozens more veggie juices.  Or, hell, you could buy actual vegetables. \n\nI am aware this careveout isn't perfect, since there are juices, candies and other grocery store items that can be \"just as bad\" as soda in some instances.  However, parsing fine distinctions between juices and snacks would require very detailed regulation that would be expensive to enforce.   \"Soda,\" by contrast, is a category that can be pretty simply defined and wherein almost all offerings are bad.\n\nSome people need caffeine to help them earn money? Fine -- coffee and tea are still allowed.  \n\nBottom line is, I see no reason that my taxes should be spent feeding the poor a carbonated mix of sugar and toxic chemicals.  Doesn't help the poor.

I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.\n\nBoring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.\n\nThe NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line.

{"title": "CMV:It's impossible to believe in free will without also believing in the supernatural.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3f1846", "selftext": "After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific way.\n\nLet's start off with premise #1\n\n Everything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. \n\nIf premise #1 is true then everything in the physical world must be determined. \n\nIf everything is determined than there is no such thing as free will.\nIf every behaviour is determined by laws of causation it is physically impossible for someone to be free, as that freedom would require the nullification of the laws of causation. In other words to believe in free will is also to believe in spontaneous magic, it's to believe that humans possess powers that could only be explained by the supernatural.\n\nFor example: In most legal traditions it is customary to judge whether someone is guilty of x crime by accumulating evidence in order to prove that  x person intentionally did this crime. Let's assume that there was enough evidence to prove without doubt that Greg Smith robbed a convenience store. Now that we have proof that it was Greg, we should ask ourselves if Greg really chose to rob the store. As soon as you ask yourself that kind of question the only scientific recourse you have is to understand Greg as a causal agent. What caused Greg to rob the store? Was it the fact that Greg is from a low socio-economic class? Was it the fact that Greg lost his job 2 weeks ago and Greg wont be able to feed his kids if he doesn't find a way to get more money? Is it the fact that Greg was abused as child? Did Greg rob the store due to complex laws of causality that are reducible to both biological and environmental reasons? Or did Greg simply rob the store because he felt like it?\n\nEven more simple decisions like choosing between a chocolate bar and an apple can be reducible to complex causal interplay between biological and environmental laws. Did you choose the chocolate bar because you like it better? Or is it because we have an evolutionary pull towards sugar and fat dense food? Is it because you read an article on naturalnews.com talking about how dark chocolate can cure your pancreas cancer? Or did you chose the apple because you grew up on an orchard farm and apples remind you of your innocent childhood? or did you choose the apple because you already had psychologically determined bias for foods that will fit in your limited calorie budget for the week?\n\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that as soon as you try to define freedom of choice scientifically it inevitably reduce down to causal mechanisms. Whether those casual mechanisms are internal/biological or external/environmental or a mix of both they are the only things that influence us and completely shape our behaviour. Anything else that can be said to have a role in our behaviours (like our \"independent volition\", our \"moral compass\" and all other notions pertaining to freedom of will) is inherently unscientific and can only be explained through a belief in the supernatural.

The expansion has encouraged players to make decks that kill quickly before the game can even begin to get interesting; this avoids the entirety of what makes Hearthstone special.\n\nAnother thing is that Legendaries are totally whack as a core concept. They come off as useful tools to take out foes but are secretly a ploy to get \"consumers\" to buy packs to try and earn them (in a free-to-play game). The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them quicker, letting them get \"better\" faster and leave other players in the dust.\n\nBlizzard has also recently lowered the chance of getting decent dailies, meaning you have a lower chance of generating in game currency, further benefiting the payers.\n\nCards involving random chance while also altering the mana curve (Voidcaller, Unstoppable Portal, Alarm-o-Bot) are devastating and should not exist.

Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound.\n\nEcho connects to Alexa, a cloud-based voice service, to provide information, answer questions, play music, read the news, check sports scores or the weather, and more\u2014instantly. All you have to do is ask.\n\nEssentially, it is an omnipresent Siri that lives in your home and is constantly listening. The device already has 23,058 reviews from testers and it is just hitting the market. Now imagine one of these in everyone's home. I will cover some of the highlights of the launch video as examples in my argument.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 1: Laziness**\n\nA lot of technology today encourages laziness. However, this takes it to a whole new level.\n\nExample: \"Alexa, add waffles to my shopping list.\" Now we don't even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least.\n\nExample: 'Alexa can provide news!' Instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events.\n\nExample: \"Alexa, what is the chance of rain?\" The woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. However, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 2: Reliance on Technology**\n\nMost of us can admit that we are uncomfortably dependent on our smart phones. However, what if our smart phone was never in our pocket? What if it was always plugged in and tempting us? This is essentially Amazon Echo. The narrator even proclaims that Echo will, \"Become a part of the family!\"\n\nExample: \"The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning.\" This is a quote from a mother as she dresses her daughter. I am aware that these are commercially invented situations being reenacted by paid actors. However, I feel as though they are fairly accurate depictions of how people will use this technology and how they will respond to it. Clearly, there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together.\n\nExample: \"The prime re-ordering is when you can ask Alexa to order something you've already ordered through your prime account.\" Now we can shop by shouting a phrase at a robot! No need to go out.\n\nI think laziness coupled with reliance on technology have been the most harmful qualities that todays youth (myself included) suffer from. We find it difficult to go out and make plans. We find it difficult to socialize. We find it difficult to talk on the phone. In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? We want things instantaneously and at our discretion.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy**\n\nMajor corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. Echo allows consumers to order things through Amazon Prime. I am not afraid of what this AI will do granted that it can always hear and learn. As long as it's just a black cylinder speaker (with no hidden flame-thrower) I don't believe we have a reason to fear an Echo uprise. Rather, I am more afraid of what the men and women behind the scenes will do. \n\nExample: 'Echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it's always ready to help!' \"I can have the water running, I can be cooking, the TV can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me.\" \n\nAll I could think while watching this was, \"Genisys is Skynet!\"\n\n---\n\nHere is a link to the [Amazon page.](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E)\n\nSo, can anyone give me some reason as to why Amazon Echo can be more helpful than harmful?\n\n**Edit:** View changed by /u/fssbmule1 with [this comment!](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3f0uzz/cmv_amazon_echo_is_an_incredibly_harmful_piece_of/ctkbyhm) Great points.

There would obviously be challenges in that sense but I'm sure rationing could be done in the digital age.\n\nThere's millions of people starving every day, yet in countries where people make slightly above average are permitted to deplete the world's food supply, waste food, and pretty much cut in line in front of others for having money. Food that could be used by poor regions is instead shipped out to feed those who can afford it. \n\nThen there's the fact that obesity has increased, at least within the US, in the past decade. Our only real solution has been to attempt to tax soft drinks or try to hurt corporations who make \"unhealthy\" food, but that does not directly treat the problem, which is over-eating. I'm sure we can all agree that if you become overweight that shows that your body has more food than it requires to live. When people are permitted to purchase as much food as they want, no matter how healthy the food ends up being, they will gain weight. This in turn causes more problems and costs money in healthcare. \n\nFood should be taxed/rationed. Based on what is factually calculated (for example, with a doctor's visit) on how much you need to consume, you should be *encouraged* (not forced) to eat the proper amount monetarily. Since eating excessively damages those who cannot afford food due to inflated food prices, as well as costs others by your deteriorating health, a tax is a reasonable/viable option. \n\nJust like you're not permitted to do harmful drugs (for the most part) or permitted to kill yourself or harm yourself (for the most part) this would at the very least be another measure to keeping people in our society healthy and from also damaging others. Since it would not be forced, you're technically still permitted to eat more food, however, you should be able to prove that you can afford your lifestyle that causes health issues and issues for others, and support the system by paying a tax, which could then be used to feed the homeless and fund welfare programs.\n\n\nHere's an article of something similar in place and proof that it's effective:\nhttp://mic.com/articles/84521/japan-has-cut-obesity-to-3-5-in-a-controversial-way-that-wouldn-t-fly-in-america\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Bus Rapid Transit is vastly superior to medium and heavy rail", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ewre2", "selftext": "Update: By heavy rail, I am referring to the US definition that refers to metro rail services only, not commuter rail (travel outside the city) or intercity/national service.\n\n[Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit) has many definitions, but I'd like to define it in its maximum state, which is when [bi-articulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-articulated_bus), modernized buses operate metro style on reinforced, dedicated roadways with much greater distances between stops than on usual bus routes and with greater frequency than buses.\n\nReasons:\n\n* Many studies have shown that a BRT system supporting the same number of riders at the same frequency as a medium or heavy rail system will be much cheaper, both to operate and support and especially in installation. It is also faster to install such a system.\n\n* Where a disabled train has the potential to bring an entire metro line to a standstill, a disabled BRT bus may be in the way, but not a total obstruction, and can easily be towed or removed from BRT roadways via frequent exit ramps even on single lane systems. Train lines can also often be taken down just by a signaling problem, something as severe as a lightbulb burning out. Buses have no such weak points.\n\n* BRT relies on existing maintenance infrastructure and can utilize existing bus drivers with only a little extra training. Trains require a lot of specialized training for what seems to be less advanced work, and from my own experience with the [MBTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority) results in far less capable vehicle operators.\n\n* As was proven during the Boston winter of 2014-2015, trains offer no severe weather benefit, and as can be seen by the mass use of buses to replace train service, a BRT system would be much more weather durable for above ground systems, especially so for systems with dedicated roadways.\n\n* Buses usually are seen as less comfortable than a train, but on a dedicated roadway that has fewer to no turns and one that is reinforced to be less bumpy, a bus can be more comfortable, especially since it offers more seating capacity for the same amount of space than most rail lines. Buses can also be replaced or refitted much more often for comfort than trains, both due to price and ease of the process.\n\n* Buses are much better placed for adoption of automated operations than trains because of much more investment in the technology for cars and buses than trains. Even automated switching has proven to be an unreliable system at the WMATA and centralized train sensing, on the other hand, [disastrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2009_Washington_Metro_train_collision).\n\nEdit:\n\nI wanted to touch on another point:\n\n* I have been on trains that would not open their doors because it could not move completely onto a train platform (by 6-10 feet). A BRT would not have as much trouble letting people off if it didn't quite reach a station.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

His response that was that it was selfish and actually quite brutal due to the energy that my offspring would consume in it's lifetime. \n\nThere are simply other ways to solve the environmental problems we currently have. Population control is a completely reactive, knee-jerk solution. \n\nSlowing down consumerism by giving corporations less power than they already have would be a good start. The big corporates are the ones that are destroying parts of the planet to find more energy and consuming mass amounts of energy to manufacture products. Due to globalisation, the problem we have nowadays is that these corporations are so big that its hard to hold individuals accountable and and they are so powerful that it's hard for the masses to stand up to them. because a lot of the time we think we have a reliance on what they are providing.\n\nChange our attitude as individuals. We need to be more conscious in regards to how we affect the our ecosystems and the planet as a whole. We rarely think about what had to be done to create the plastic packaging from the food we eat, or what has to be done to power our homes. There needs to be more awareness here. Too often I hear people will not recycle because other countries don't and they don't see the point. It is also hard to convince individuals to take this attitude and not leave their lights on when they go out at night when Las Vegas is constantly lit like a Christmas Tree.\n\nIt's almost like we need a substantial event to take place before it is indeed too late, the energy issue is starting to pick up traction but we need to move quicker. It absolutely must be on top of every political agenda of every government in the world.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point, a friend once questioned why people in third world countries mainly in Africa would continue to have children and that they needed to be educated and discouraged from this as they are contributing to the exponential population growth we are currently enduring. Developed countries consume a lot more than developing countries.\n\nSome of you may argue that countries with larger populations need more energy, I ague back that Indonesia's population is only 29% less than that of the United States. However the consumption of the United States is 95% more than Indonesia. \n\nI say again, the problem is not the size of the population just the actions we are currently carrying out. There are enough square miles for every human being on this planet ten times over. \n\nLastly, I do think there is some legitimacy to this claim. But more people do not necessarily mean more energy consumption. I don't have any empirical evidence and will try to get some but I can bet a family of 6 in East Africa consume a lot less than your average family of 3 in the United States. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I think most education beyond Middle School is useless - UNLESS it directly pertains to your field.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ev0gt", "selftext": "I've seen a lot of CMVs regarding College education being unnecessary but I haven't actually seen a great deal regarding High School. For me, I thought that my college was a very interesting and career-oriented program. But High School was almost the opposite.\n\nI'm not going to speculate at the reasons; it could be the focus on standardized tests, or the push to treat every student exactly the same regardless of their actual abilities, or the fact that they're simply not relevant in modern society.\n\nWhatever the case may be, I felt during most of my time in HS that none of my education was remotely relevant. History I found interesting, but utterly inapplicable beyond basic knowledge and political past. Science has never been something I found remotely useful in my daily life, then or now, and after very basic Biology (and I mean very, very basic) nothing was applicable. By Chemistry, I can't even name a class topic beyond something as general as (periodic table).\n\nEnglish classes have applied to me, but I recognize my own bias - I love to write, I love to read, and I would love for my efforts to one day lead me into a career as a novelist. If it wasn't for that, I would've had *slightly* more use for this class than the others, but only because writing is a fairly universal application, which I appreciate the education for.\n\nMath is by far the worst offender. History you could argue must be known to avoid repeating, and Biology can give us insight into our own bodies... but I have no use for anything I learned after 8th grade in Math class. I've never used tangent, cosine, or sine. I've never once had to determine what (3x^2+5)(2x-2) was, simplified. I don't even remember what the quadratic formula was used for, much less the entire thing.\n\nAnd of course, the miscellaneous (Art, Music, etc...) that are utterly useless to anyone without an interest in the field. While fun as children, and important to explore, I fail to see these as useful fields for non-artists/musicians beyond basic socialization that could be fulfilled in any other fun/explorative class.\n\nI scored a 34 on my ACTs and a 36 in my math, but I specifically took as few Math classes as possible during my time in High School. I needed three years, and used them to take AP Statistics - not because I thought it was useful, but because I wanted to *avoid* college math classes. My fourth year, I took Math For a Living - and it was by far the single best thing I could've done. We covered checks, tax forms, account management... basically all the things I think should be mandatory anyway for every student, because they *actually apply to every student*.\n\nI went on to forget 90% of what I learned shortly after exiting high school, retain just enough to get along, and enter a degree which specialized drastically. I had 0 math classes (got credit for 1 from AP test) 2 English classes (both electives, got out of my 2 mandatory through AP Tests), two science classes (even less applicable than my HS classes; Earth Science and Biology), and three history/government classes (Plus an elective, educational and fun but not useful, except for Government). Other than that it was a few paper-writing classes (pretty universally useful), a speech class, and the rest were 75-90% career/field-related classes, many taught by people who were in/left the field.\n\nI guess TL;DR: CMV - Virtually nothing we learn after MS is applicable beyond passing tests to get extra funding for our schools. Time in HS would be better spent teaching common sense, problem-solving skills, basic computer literacy, communication, working in teams, and how to apply said knowledge instead of \"Find X with this equation, this is how many protons are in Oxygen, what was the name of John Quincy Adams' Secretary?\". I also believe this is a significant reason many people feel so overwhelmed after finishing education at a college/university and are facing the world for the first real time.\n\n**EDIT:** I'm updating this to say that while \"These classes help you figure out what you want to do\" may be accurate (and even has good points), it doesn't change my view that no matter what field you *eventually* go into, 80-90% of your HS education is useless to your field and has no application in real-life. Given that college attendance is a non-mandatory (and only recently became \"necessary\" to find a job in non-specialized fields), I should include in my view that I don't want to see the *erosion* of these classes, just that they shouldn't be required as much (3-4 years of math, 3-4 years of english, 2-3 years of sciences, 2+ years of government/history), and that we should focus more on basic knowledge, applicable skills (taxes, investments, budgeting, how to live your life, interview skills, resume building, etc...), and offering specializations (Statistics, Chemistry, Physics, non-basic History, Art, Music, Literature &amp; Interpretations) as electives rather than forcing them on kids.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: \"Offense is taken, not given\" is an illegitimate argument since it can just as easily be applied to any emotion we have control over (which according to the stoics is most of them).", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3euv6y", "selftext": "I see memes and statements all the time around the idea that \"offense is taken not given\". Usually in the context of someone protesting that something is offensive, and people poking fun at them for the unreasonableness of the offense they took.\n\nBut while I would agree it is possible to behave as if something is far more offensive than most reasonable people would agree it is, this is a qualitatively different issue than \"offense is given not taken\".\n\nStoicism is the ancient philosophy that pain and suffering can be made far more endurable by your reaction to it; specifically, deliberate indifference shields you from suffering. The stoic solution to pain and misfortune is to refuse to let it dominate you and therefore reduce its ultimate harm.\n\nSimilar ideas of detaching yourself from suffering or seeking value in painful experiences can be found in Buddhism and Existentialism. Viktor Frankl, holocaust survivor, wrote *Man's Search for Meaning* about how focusing on the positive and meaningful aspects of life in the midst of a horrible experience helped him and other's survive and rebuild their lives.\n\nSo I agree with the notion that someone can stoically endure offensive behavior, and I'd even agree with the idea that this is, for the individual, the least mentally stressful or distracting way of dealing with these experience. This doesn't necessarily mean complete internalization - passivity is not the same as stoicism.\n\nThe problem I have is with anyone asserting that because offense is 'taken and no given', bad behavior should not be called out, or should be suffered silently. Words and actions *can* betray sordid underlying attitudes. They can make people feel unwelcome. Saying that people should silently tolerate this emotional harm from offensive remarks because they control their own attitudes is like saying people should silently tolerate any harm or injustice, simply because they can (according to stoicism).\n\nLet's step back to the specific case of the 'unreasonably sensitive'.\n\nIf you are drunk and shove someone, we'd probably agree that it's a bit hysterical and even unreasonable for that person to sue you for assault. But you are still in the wrong; you've done something wrong and you could have saved yourself the trouble by not shoving them.\n\nAnd if that person had a bizarre medical condition where his skull was eggshell thing and he fell over and shattered his skull, then you'd *definitely* be liable, and 'he shouldn't have been out in a bar, where people shove people' or 'he should have worn a football helmet' or 'he should have kept his balance' or 'he should endure his serious skull injury without suffering because of the existential meaninglessness of all our lives which forces us to find meaning subjectively' are all horrible excuses that won't and shouldn't help you in court!\n\nIf you bumped into this man by accident with the same result, you'd not be a criminal, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to watch where you're going and not accidentally knock them over.\n\nThe same goes for emotional harm. Some people really are emotionally fragile and some aren't themselves but like to advocate for those who are. And maybe like the thin-skulled man shouldn't become a boxer there are some decisions the emotionally fragile should make carefully, but that doesn't mean you should go around shoving people and insulting those who call you out.\n\n**TL;DR** To change my view, convince me that there is something substantially differentiating offense from other types of harm and suffering that justifies \"offense is taken not given\" as a reaction to those saying a thing is offensive, rather than defense of the thing itself. Or attack from another angle you think of."}

{"title": "CMV: The SJW movement uses language of the elite and privileged, and thus does very little to empower or educate.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3eu8tm", "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with *most* SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.\n\nA college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.\n\nThese are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.\n\nHonestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?\n\nI don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, \"Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.\"\n\nAgain, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Frieza unintentionally saved the universe by destroying planet Vegeta and exterminating the Saiyans", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3etduv", "selftext": "Frieza was a psychotic mass murderer and tyrant but was generally very collected emotionally. Rather than destroy planets for pure entertainment he cleared them out and sold them to species with a need for a new world. It was evil of course, but there was a certain logic to it and seeing as he was just one tyrant in the vastness of the universe it was somewhat unlikely that he'd ever find your world. \n\nHad he not destroyed the Saiyans every other species in the galaxy or universe would have been destroyed.\n\nSaiyans are completely insane. Had Goku not been raised by humans his and his father's ridiculous powers would have been used, more likely lazily guided, by King Vegeta to commit relentless genocide. Saiyans double their power after they almost die, they can turn into giant apes so powerful that five can exterminate all life from one planet, and for whatever reason they can continuously transform into more and more powerful beings. Their ability to turn super saiyan seems to be rather easy if they face enough significant challenges, and their singular interest in combat ensures that they will meet more threats and, rather than get crippled or exhausted, they will only get more powerful after each challenge. Further they don't seem to age as most creatures do, remaining with the physique of a thirty year old well into their autumn years.\n\nIt would appear that the Saiyans were a relatively young species by the time Frieza destroyed them. They conquered planet Tuffle from a nearby moon and established themselves as a civilized species all within the reign of the first and last King Vegeta, going on to introduce themselves to nearby worlds with mass destruction and genocide. Goku and Vegeta's unlimited strength would suggest that eventually, if the Saiyans survived as a species, there could be hundreds of Super Saiyan 3's and 4's wreaking havoc all over the galaxy for no reason other than pure sport. Broly, yet another powerful Saiyan, appears capable of destroying several worlds in a matter of minutes without even needing a spaceship.\n\nIn essence, given a few centuries of constant battle, there would have been thousands of Super Saiyans with the same world-destroying power of Frieza. While he destroyed the species for his own selfish reasons and fears he ensured that, for a time, he was the only individual besides Broly (and later Buu) capable of destroying worlds with ease. This ensured that, statistically, the likelihood of having your world destroyed in the largeness of the universe by one of these three individuals was quite low. \n\nNow imagine billions of Saiyans, billions Brolys Gokus and Vegetas, billions of relentlessly bloodthirsty fighters, capable of transforming into giant apes and having unlimited power ups, fighting and killing purely for the insatiable thrill and fun of it. Goku and Vegeta, even after becoming righteous individuals, clearly demonstrate no interest beyond fighting and eating. Sex, pursuit of knowledge, spending time with family, art... these are at best tertiary interests. Frieza, at the very least, enjoyed having his much weaker minions do much of his fighting for him meaning theoretically one could be spared genocide by a chance encounter with him. There is no avoiding genocide after a Saiyan scouting party discovers your world. \n\nIf in the infinite vastness of the universe there was a planet Vegeta that shared it with our Earth, ideally far away from the Earth Goku eventually landed on with its King Dogs and Dragon Balls chances are we would have been exterminated for no reason beyond the amusement of a species of irreconcilably insane monsters; and Frieza's atrocity spared us all. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The US government should give everyone a personal retirement fund.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3esskw", "selftext": "I think the US government should give every citizen a lump sum at birth or naturalization, and invest it for them in an index fund modeled on (and possibly administered alongside) the Thrift Savings Plan funds for Federal employees.  The funds would be kept in the account until the person reaches age 65 and then be able to be withdrawn tax free like a Roth IRA.\n\nBecause of the very long timeframe, even a small lump sum like $1000 could become quite a lot of money.  Stocks have about a 7% inflation adjusted rate of return over the very long run.  Even assuming a somewhat lower rate like 5%, you'd be multiplying the money by 24x after inflation.  At 7%, you'd be multiplying by 81x.  \n\nThere are about 4 million births and 800,000 naturalizations in the US each year.  For rounding sake, call it 5 million people.  So the total program cost at $1000 per capita would be about $5 billion a year, which is a very small slice of the Federal budget, plus admin costs, which wouldn't be that huge.\n\nIf you extended it to current citizens, which I think would be advisable as well, you'd add a one time lump sum payment of $300 billion or so, which is substantial, but is smaller than a lot of economic stimulus programs.\n\nFor persons already born or naturalized, I'd do this also as a one time payment.  I'd probably copy the Roth rules and make it subject to a penalty for withdrawal in the first 5 years, but with no withdrawal permitted before 65.\n\nI would default people into one of the TSP's lifecycle funds based on year of birth (probably needing to make some new ones since TSP doesn't make plans targeted at infants), but let them change their allocation within the TSP if they chose.\n\nDoing this would substantially aid people in retiring with dignity, provide a lot of people with a toehold in the market which would encourage future investments, and leverage a small initial investment over a really long time frame to get big future benefits.\n\nAdditionally, making the accounts locked from withdrawals (which you can only really do with government seed money) will provide people with some guarantee of savings at retirement, and protect against financial calamity completely wiping them out.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Some types of suffering can probably only be felt by humans, but accepting this isn't contradicting my claim, which is that like suffering should be given like importance.\n\nMy view is that the distinction between humans and animals is not in itself morally relevant, just as race and gender distinctions are not morally relevant. \n\nGiving preference to human interests over animal interests simply because humans are 'our own' and it is natural to prefer 'our own' is no more justifiable than racism or sexism, and any justification of our treatment of animals based on this necessarily must also allow those prejudices.\n\nJustifications based on humans possessing some quality over and above what animals possess (eg sentience, self awareness, ability to use tools etc) can never justify the distinct separation between humans and animals that we have in our society. This is simply because there is no such quality that is possessed by all humans and no animals - for instance, many crows use tools and pigs are more 'intelligent' than toddlers.\n\nFinally, the argument that animals cannot have rights because they cannot have duties (and rights are correlative to duties) fails insofar as we give rights to children and the mentally handicapped, recognising that the 'duty' applies not to the rights-bearer but to others in society, and therefore it is irrelevant whether animals can possess duties."}

While many support the latter, the former is reviled in some circles.\n\nI think the argument for supporting the latter applies to the former: Just as you would like to avoid/be alerted to spoilers until you've gotten to that point in the story (you're 'narratively' prepared), it makes sense to alert others of content which may be emotionally distressing so that they can engage with it when they're emotionally prepared.\n\nYou could say that there's a presumption of eventual engagement with Spoiler Alerts, you wouldn't be worried about them if didn't plan on following the story. With TWs, someone could duck out of all triggering content forever. But that doesn't seem to be reason to denounce TWs as a whole: you're still saving that person and many others (who could be working to overcome those triggers) undue emotional distress.\n\nYou also could argue with my definition of emotionally distressing content, stating that it very easily leads to a slippery slope ending with everyone having to tag all of their content, but I'm not terribly persuaded by that argument. For one, regardless of a individual communities definitions of spoilers (we all know Snape killed Dumbledore by now, right?), endings and most recent episodes are universally considered spoilers. Similarly, I'm sure that sexual violence and gore can be considered universal triggers. Discovering how broad a community's definition of spoilers/triggers is done by engaging with that community. As for giving TWs being too much of an inconvenience, I think that's more of a matter of getting used to it: you extend that courtesy when discussing spoilers, why not for when you're discussing triggers? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: (NSFW) One needs proper consent to masturbate about someone.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3es79p", "selftext": "Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.\n\nIf we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.\n\nThis line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.\n\nSo please, CMV!\n\nEDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.\n\nThanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Touch-Typing should be a required skill for university.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ertta", "selftext": "I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent.\n\nSome points that I use to support this argument:\n\n1. Faster typing = more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. \n\n2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you.\n\n3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. \n\nSo, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. \n\nWhy university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. \n\nAm I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. \n\n**Edit 1**\n\nWell, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. \n\nThe argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill.\n\nFor those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing.\n\nAnd for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type.\n\n**Edit 2, View Changed**\n\n/u/cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. \n\nThanks for all the posts and cordial discussion. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've noticed these arguments occur with many people who consider themselves feminist (actual not tumblr). \n\nPersonally I believe that there are issues with treatment of both genders. Women have higher rates of rape outside prison, a very small but statistically significant pay gap (~95:100), stricter standards of beauty, some discrimination in STEM fields in professional environments, general treatment at skill levels, domestic violence rates, sex ed in certain regions, Madonna/Whore complex treatment, etc. I also believe men have issues such as higher rates of workplace injuries and death, PTSD due to higher enlisting rates, treatment towards mental health issues, homelessness, mate selection, physical violence, university enrolment and graduation rates, punishment for the same crime, paternity and divorce issues, etc.\n\nIn the end I don't believe that one gender has a clear advantage over the other. I believe that both genders have issues they face in modern society, and to quantify them would take away from the struggles of either. Hence despite agreeing on many points with feminism, I would not be considered a feminist because I don't agree with the core belief that women are the oppressed gender. This seems to bother my friend who feels strongly about feminism, because despite the fact that we agree on many points, that one distinction is not something we agree on. He finds it insulting that I would compare out-of-prison rapes to something like PTSD from war in terms of statistics of percentage occurring to each gender. Personally I find it shitty because he doesn't acknowledge that men have some serious issues as well, and no one gender is undoubtedly superior in the eyes of society. \n\nIn many other parts of the world, I agree with him 100%; women are significantly more oppressed in many Islamic countries for example. I just think the only factor in which men are clearly superior in practice and eyes of society are physical abilities, but otherwise both genders deal with some horrible things and no one gender is undoubtedly oppressed."}

I think we can all agree that misogyny is bad and that scholarships are good, but knowing that you only ended up somewhere because you met the right quota isn't rewarding.\n\nI'm not saying welfare or charities are bad by any means, but the way we go about supporting underprivileged people is wrong. Everything has its token minority in some way. Shouldn't we let people's work stand on its own?\n\nIf someone does something outstanding, does it make it better that he was a minority?

I thought by now Americans would have realized that as Gaul was to Rome, the Hispanic ethnicity is to the United States.\n\nI feel like the immigration reform/acculturation issue of Hispanics illogically gets second fiddle billing in the United States behind racism against blacks re: the police. There is a not insignificant proportion of the population that feels racism against African-Americans is largely self-inflicted by their disproportionate violent crime rate and anti-white attitudes, but racism against Hispanics makes literally no sense whatsoever. There is no logical explanation for it period. We need to address it ASAP.\n\nI feel *every* issue of racism or whatever is completely irrelevant compared to the urgency that we need to open the doors to Hispanic America.\n\nConsider:\n\n**Hispanics are the fastest growing minority group in the United States. They are also the largest minority group, with 50 million today.**\n\n**Hispanics are a significant proportion of the population of the biggest American states, including California, Texas, New York, Florida, and the entire Southwest.**\n\n**Hispanics have the highest percentage of new small businesses being opened. This indicates they are assimilating, working to better themselves, and throwing their weight around economically.**\n\n**Hispanics culturally tend to have strong family values. This seems compatible with \"mainstream\" American culture.**\n\n**Hispanics, as studies show, are virtually completely assimilated by the third generation, following acculturation trends of other immigrant groups such as the Irish, Chinese, Italians, Japanese, etc.**\n\n**The United States forcibly and immorally annexed land from Mexico 150 years ago. I am not advocating irredentism obviously, but many Hispanics' descendants found themselves on the wrong side of the border through no fault of their own, and became full U.S citizens. Punking these citizens is morally wrong.**\n\n**The United States has close ties with Mexico, Central America, and South America. These are booming regions. **\n\n**Even \"illegal\" immigrants fill economic niches not otherwise filled by \"legal\" immigrants or citizens. They help the economy without siphoning off jobs that would go to \"legal\" citizens. Many of them pay taxes.**\n\n**Hispanics are projected to be 25% of the population by 2050.**\n\nI feel strongly that taking an antagonistic attitude against this minority group is not just morally wrong, it is economically counterproductive and demographically suicidal in the longterm. With the aging white population, it is very likely that a population that has a Hispanic plurality will be taking America into the deeper decades of the 21st century.\n\nAgain, I do not understand why people sweep aside reconciling racist White America with the future demographic plurality (and immigration reform) in favor of frankly horse that have been beaten to death.\n\nWith that in mind, I feel there should be :\n\n- stronger social taboos against discrimination or stereotyping of Hispanics\n\n- that Spanish should be added as a required subject in K-12 education throughout the nation,\n \n- that official cultural grants and initiatives should be granted ala Japan's \"Cool Japan\" or Korea's \"Hallyu\" initiatives to encourage the cultural growth of the Hispanic-American market and industry,\n\n- that Spanish should be added as the de facto second official language of the United States\n\n\n\n**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: A Statistics course should be required as standard high school education", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3eqdj5", "selftext": "I believe that statistics is a far more useful mathematical tool than some of the other disciplines of math taught in our current (American) education system.\n\nThere are many reasons I believe this to be true, but the most convincing of all is the staggering amount of misuse of statistics that I witness here on reddit every day. People seem to get in the habit of picking a study that claims *\"X% of Y are Z\"* or that *\"There is a strong correlation between X and Y\"*and spit it out to strengthen whatever they're arguing. People often overlook the many factors that could be contributing to a correlation and construe the underlying truths to fit their case or story. To make matters worse, after someone has represented a false/poor statistic, the general public of reddit sees the numbers and mindlessly upvotes/supports a claim because they also don't know better. I believe that a simple bit of education on how 'confouning' works or what 'statistically significant' actually means could do a lot of good and correct people's intuition.\n\nI'm not sure what the standard/minimum math cirriculum for the entire US is, but my high school expected us to graduate with at least Pre-Calculus knowledge. IMO, the benefits of Statistics in the real world outweigh the benefits of Pre-Calculus. Pre-Calculus can't really be applicable to all career paths one might choose to follow after graduating high-school. If you're going into higher education, then you will usually be required to take a Calculus course anyway and will probably have to encounter Pre-Calculus there. But I'm concerned with the vast amount of people ([34.1%](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/business/fewer-us-high-school-graduates-opt-for-college.html)) who live their lives without college education (at least in their younger years). Most high-school requiring jobs won't find use in much of Pre-Calculus' or Geometry's curriculum. But Statistics is a tool that is universal to all people in our society -regardless of job- because it teaches you how to read data and be wary of what might be misrepresented in it. The average high-school grad won't ever go home at the end of the day and say: *\"Shit, I really need to use partial fraction decomposition on this fraction\"* or *\"I forget, is &lt;(Sin(tanx))/(cosx)&gt; the same thing as  &lt;(2 cos(x) sin((sin(2 x))/(1+cos(2 x))))/(1+cos(2 x)&gt; ?\"*\n\nHowever, the study of Statistics teaches people intuition with data, which is ubiquitous in our day and age regardless of your profession or background.\n\n**EDIT: I GUESS THE TITLE SHOULD BE CHANGED TO: CMV: A Statistics course should be required as standard high school education (IN PLACE OF A CURRENT DISCIPLINE OF MATH TAUGHT)**\n\n**EDIT 2: I've received a large number of comments from people who believe that Statistics requires the knowledge of Calculus and even beyond. This is simply not true. The AP Statistics wikipedia page quotes:**\n\n&gt; the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course\n\n**I'm talking about basic Statistics that's more conceptual than number-based. I took the AP course with [THIS BOOK](http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Statistics-Daren-S-Starnes/dp/142924559X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1438027231&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+practice+of+statistics+david+moore&amp;refinements=p_lbr_one_browse-bin%3ADavid+S.+Moore) and the class was very much doable without calculus and geared towards someone my age.** \n\n**EDIT 3: A funny [dilbert comic](http://i.imgur.com/I7chPLw.gif) from the Stats book that partially sums up my feelings.**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Politicians (specifically Presidential election candidates) deserve to be taken out of context.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3eq514", "selftext": "Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news ([x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/), [x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/)) after delivering a speech in which she said that \"for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear.\" Publications from across the political spectrum tore her a new one for this comment in perceived poor taste. The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    \n\n(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the \"sound-bit culture\" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   \n\nSpecifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically \"Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad.\" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    \n\nTo me, the fact that this \"quotable\" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    \n\nWe (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Racism doesn't exist, it has to do with a difference in cultures and it's not worth getting rid of", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3epz2f", "selftext": "I'd like to start off by summarizing my view first:\n\nRacism is the \"easy way\" of distinguishing between cultures, which is what actually bothers human beings and makes them be racist. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that shows humans are capable of being racist due to skin color. It's just a generalization we have made to make the issue easier to define and by doing so we're making it harder to actually ever get rid of racism. However, to get rid of racism, we have to blend our cultures too much and I personally feel that the positives don't outweigh the negatives, because I'd rather have humans continue to be diverse.\n\nSo now let's get a little more descriptive on why I think this way. I think a good place to start is slavery. This occurred mainly because it was something that was done by Africans. They sold prisoners off and there was a demand for nearly-free labor. It didn't matter that these people were black. It was just where the slaves happened to come from, and throughout the years, the way the system worked, it just became synonymous to black people being inferior because it was easier to generalize it that way.\n\nThen let's go to Nazi Germany. I feel like this a better example, because Jewish people have a sense of strong culture and stuck together. This helped them do better than others during the depression and they also easily became the scapegoat by having a different culture and kind of being the \"weird kids\" that never integrated properly into society. This still occurs in a lot of neighborhoods, where Jewish people like living in communities together. For example, there are Jewish neighborhoods in Toronto and New York. And of course, there's an entire country. \n\nThis is where we get into the general picture. Each country has their own culture and that's why they're different countries. The laws, the people, and the past all make up this culture. Even within a country there will be different groups of people who were either forced to be segregated or segregated themselves to preserve their culture. This difference in culture or fear of other cultures that we do not understand is the core of racism. There's no such thing as racism and most people who do not fall into the bandwagon of associating an entire race with generalizations aren't \"racist\" but people can and should have different cultures and even frown upon certain negative aspects of other people's cultures.\n\nBy mixing all cultures, we can effectively get rid of racism. If everyone's the \"same\" then there's nothing too different that would put you off from an entire \"race\" of people that are similar in some way. However, this is not worth it, in my opinion, because having different cultures is what makes people and the world interesting.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The Confederate Flag Doesn't Represent Slavery", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3epy4h", "selftext": "This post is referring to [this flag](http://thatoregonlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rebel-flag-silk.jpg). It is colloquially referred to as the Rebel Flag/Confederate Flag. The flag is derived from The Stainless Banner. It was used to distinguish the Confederate soldiers from the Union soldiers in battle. It was created for a battalion in Northern Virginia. For this post, I will refer to the flag in question by the term \"Rebel Flag\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Slavery is wrong. I am not condoning slavery or supporting those who do.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1. The Flag was not created to represent a political party. It was to represent **a territory of people**. The Confederacy was a territory, not a political party. It was created due to political differences, but the Confederacy was a group of states, not a political party.\n\n2. The flag was not created to represent an idea or philosophy. Again, it was to distinguish a territory of people.\n\n3. The comparison to the Nazi flag is not a strong argument. The Nazi's were a political party, not a territory of people. Germany has had a separate national flag since 1919.\n\n4. Just because a flag represents a territory which has horrific parts in it's history does not diminish the regions culutural identification. the American Flag should be tainted by the Trail of Tears and other events such as the Japanese American Internment. We still fly this flag as it represents the country and it's people.\n\n5. The KKK may use the Rebel Flag but has also used the [American Flag](http://core0.staticworld.net/images/article/2015/06/kkk-carrying-american-flag-100593178-orig.jpg) in many events/rallies throughout history. A group using a flag they did not create does not change it's origin.\n\n6. The Confederacy lost the war. This does not mean people decended from those people cannot continue to recognize their region using the Rebel Flag.\n\n7. Many people in the Confederacy supported slavery, but this was not true of every citizen. The flag represents a people who were not unanimous on the political ideas of those in power. Those in power make political actions. Racism was prevalent on both sides of the war. Both sides were wrongly raising inequality amongst people. *But people still lived outside of the war and held life experiences worth regarding and celebrating.*\n\n8. Most people defending the flag are defending their people's history and culture, not slavery. Their peoples history includes music, food, and art which was and is distinguishable from Northern culture.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe flag is recognized and shown as a symbol of the southern area and all aspects of its culture.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Adjusted formatting issue.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate the time everyone has taken to respond to the subject. I know the issue is highly debated and very much escalated due to recent media attention. It's because of this media attention that I'm seeking to understand the situation better. As the rules state, I am open to change. I do feel strongly about my perspective being raised in the South, however. I have seen this flag my entire life and was raised in a way that developed the perspective I currently hold. I also see this flag daily and amongst people of multiple races hence my interest in the discussion.\n\nUpdate 2: Reddit, you know that downvote button isn't a disagree button. Use it for irrelevant comments and spam, not posts that don't coincide with your perspective.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I'm frugal and it hurts to not save with my money just for sake of freedom. I don't quite have enough to buy a place yet, and the living cost here is barely affordable where I would almost live by paycheck.  The biggest drawback to me is not being able to take a girl home, which I feel could be resolved once I start dating and having relationship with someone, then I feel would be appropriate to move out because we can split rent cost together and give me some breathing room financially.

In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.\n\n**Edit:** People have pointed out that there are sports that take less skill, like Frisbee and swimming. I guess I was thinking of the slightly more mainstream sports. But my point still stands, aside from that."}

The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.\n\nThere are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. \n\nI reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.\n\n If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.\n\n**EDIT:** *Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them.*\n\n**EDIT:** *Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where water is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled water. As mentioned above, that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was thrown out in the UK.* \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This is patently false; Pao presided over an enormous increase in user growth and revenues, a growth curve that had begun well before her promotion. Furthermore, the company's performance was the not the reason for her ouster; instead, it was due to user and moderator dissatisfaction; nothing that was present or predictable at the time of her promotion many months earlier.

{"title": "CMV:Men have a more difficult development in life", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3eoimj", "selftext": "Some people like to argue that men have a more difficult development then woman do.  Here are some arguments they have:\n\n1. \"After controlling for the arrest offense, criminal history, and other prior characteristics, \"men receive 63% longer sentences on average than women do,\" and \"[w]omen are\u2026twice as likely to avoid incarceration if convicted.\"https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx\nThis fact does not support the politically correct notion that there is a \"war on women\" in the USA, or that America is patriarchal and full of \"male privilege\".  To the contrary, it says that women are more likely to be protected by society than men, and are given special \"female privileges\" which makes their development easier.\n\n2. In the USA all male citizens MUST register with the Selective Service when they turn 18 so they can be drafted into war if \"needed\" and possibly die. This is a highly sexist law at its core. What would happen if we had a law that only drafted African-Americans, or Latinos, or people with blue eyes? Why don't we draft women? Should we? Some nations like Israel do.\n\n3. If a woman and a man engage in sexual intercourse and pregnancy results, a woman can make decisions that disregards the man\u2019s input but that affect him drastically. If the woman decides to terminate the pregnancy, the man has no legal say in the matter. And if the woman decides to continue the pregnancy, again without any discretion from the man, he is legally responsible for child support for 18 years. If he fails to support such a child he can have his wages garnished and/or be imprisoned. (Please note I AM NOT CLAIMING that a man SHOULD have a legal right here, just that he has no legal standing - it is entirely a woman's choice about how to deal with the pregnancy, and this gives her more control and power than a man in that circumstance) For example, a woman can have the baby and then give up a child for adoption against the man's wishes - http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/31/22124881-dad-files-130m-lawsuit-after-son-in-utah-is-given-up-for-adoption.

We know some of the solutions but unfortunately civilisation as we know it has too much inertia as all of those demonic cabals have infiltrated the world's governments, especially the USA. As long as the USA exists with its greedy tentacles there cannot be true development. At the same time, we are overusing natural resources to a point where there is probably only enough left for a couple billion people on Earth at any given time; sharply reducing birthrates is out of the question without massive culls of elders. The best possible solution would be for a nuclear war that allows us to go back to the Middle Ages (technology-wise) and start from scratch, re-industrialising based on what we already know works in the short run but is destructive in the long run vs. what is actually good and sustainable. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'll use the most \"accepted\" version of the story: \n\n*Jesus was one with God, part of the Holy Trinity and one day he decided humanity should be saved with the ultimate sacrifice: his own life. In order to do that he came to Earth and lived like a normal human, teaching his ways to others. 30 and something years after his human birth he met his fate. Tortured and humiliated he sacrificed his life to give humanity a chance of redemption, he was the Lamb of God. After that he was resurrected and went back to heaven to live like god for the rest of eternity* \n\n\nAlright, this is a big deal because a divine creature came to Earth to sacrifice himself for humans, an unthinkable act. Problem is, Jesus choices were:\n\n1. Save humanity and suffer a lot of pain for a couple months (if you consider the very act of becoming human a bad thing, then let's say 30ish years) and go back to Heaven\n2. Not save humanity and stay as god forever\n\nProvided you're not completely cold and oblivious being, 1) is clearly the only logical choice here, you are trading an infinitely small piece of your life for saving an entire race that you created, why not? Compared to eternity the suffering is meaningless. It's like if for giving 1 cent to a person Bill Gates could save that persons life. Of course he would. Anyone would. You don't need to be pure goodness to do that, not even close.\n\nSo, what is the merit of Jesus sacrifice? "}

Reasons to move them: \n\n* the drought is expected to continue for quite a while. The areas were never suitable for supporting large populations and production in the first place. \n\n* The move could be used to stimulate economic growth in the places people are moved to. \n\n* Lowering the population even by a fraction would loosen the demands the area faces- so it'd be a good move regardless of what fraction you move. \n\n* As a country, we're not very population dense- there is plenty of space. \n\n* The US is already hemorrhaging money, I'm sure politicians can find a little more.\n\nThe way I would do this is to offer people choices of various cities (with caps in place to a certain extent.). Then the government can assist in building housing to move the new refugees. Once people move in, they'd be given a certain amount of free stay (say a year.) and then be offered up a regular lease agreement based on the area's cost of living. As these empty they can be used as low cost housing for families. \n\nThe cities that are chosen (specifically the areas of the cities that are expanded on) would be placed under a federal tax refund/break to people creating new business there (some tax experts would have to write up the conditions for this). Boosting the local economies and bringing jobs to the areas. The cities can also be given a boost to their education funds for a certain amount of time. This is where the city benefits.\n\nThe areas they were leaving would have less demand on their water reserves and could reevaluate how they are managing their resources. They'd be given more time to come up with long term solutions of their own instead of having to crunch down on it right now.\n\nEdit: It's 7AM eastern time and I should probably try to go to bed. I'll respond further when I wake up.\n\nFurther Edits for clarity: \n\nResponse to /u/Mckoijion RE: Costs\n\nAdditionally. 75 billion dollars is NOTHING in the scope of US government spending. The Federal government spent something like 3.6 trillion dollars for 2015. 75 billion comes out to about 2% of the annual federal budget. The federal government spends .4 trillion on welfare alone (this number does not include pensions or healthcare). I'm way to tired to track where that goes state-wise. 75 billion would represent 18% of the welfare budget. Some of that would really be more reallocated than removed. (Source on the Federal spending numbers)\n\nFor infrastructure, get cities to chip in. They would have a great potential to benefit from the new residents, jobs, businesses and services- not to mention since the tax break would be federal, they'd get new sources of income. They have to bite on the costs of infrastructure. Everyone would have some skin in the game- increasing everyone's drive to make it a successful system."}

{"title": "CMV: The European left has failed", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3en5e4", "selftext": "Hey r/CMV,\n\nThe topic I'd like to discuss is the current position of the political left, represented by parties such as the British Labour, the German SPD or the Sweden Social Democrats (which are very diverse, of course). Over the last few years most of these parties have suffered significant losses and have not been able to keep up their role as \"people's parties\" due to this. An exception is Southern Europe where parties such as Podemos and SYRIZA attract large numbers of new followers (I suspect SYRIZA will be a huge disappointment for many, keeping in line with my thesis).\n\nNow I think there are various factors to this. First of all, a lot of people in Europe feel their economic situation is worsening compared to the others. Governments talk about \"..% growth in the past 5 years\" or \"the average Belgian is now ..% richer than in 2010\", and I don't claim they are wrong, but a lot of people are not seeing this kind of development. The poor to lower-class people. There's been talk of a widening gap between rich and poor for ages, and it seems that this is taking its toll. The left parties in general seem to have failed in coming up with a solution and sell it to people, even though these should be their main target audience. Besides this they don't have a lot to offer politically (in general; for me they still do).\n\nAnother issue is the increasing adoption of traditional left-wing policies by conservative and right-wing parties. Take the FN in France, which claims \"it's neither left nor right\" because they have very right-wing policies (I don't have to elaborate in which areas) coupled with typical welfare state ideas. So to a lot of troubled people, the FN have taken the role of the protecting \"worker's movement\", and in fact one of the boasting points of the FN is that it wants to spend more money on the French poor by cutting welfare for others. In a non-judgmental way, the FN is like a selfish left-wing party. The same you see everywhere, in Denmark etc., where a lot of parties like the DPP or the SD claim things along the line \"there's not enough money, and elderly people go first\".\n\nSo why do I not count these parties as \"left\" or \"centre-left\"? I don't like the 1-dimensional \"left-right\" distinction, but in the traditional political spectrum the left has also a social meaning. Left-wing parties tend to be very socially liberal (homosexuality, drugs, protection of minorities) while right-wing ones are usually not (conservative family ideals, drugs, etc). Of course a lot of the right-wing parties I've mentioned have moved with the times (the FN is not as toxically anti-semitic and homophobic anymore, Wilders is supportive of LGBT rights), but they are still on the conservative spectrum, especially when it comes to the rights of LGBT people and foreigners. The \"left\" ideal is not to make any distinction based on those things.\n\nIt seems that a lot of people can't identify with the traditional left ideals anymore in times like these (which are difficult for everyone) and the right-wing spectrum has been able to take advantage of that. These have been my observations. I've also got a troubled relationship with the left parties in my country, but I consider them my best option. Thus I'm very open to having my view CMV'd, although I'm sceptical as of now. I hope we can have a balanced debate!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

He simply doesn't give a fuck about politicians, and is willing to call them out for being the shit they are. And the rest doesn't matter at all. I don't think it's primarily a racist element that supports him. I don't think it's that people have any clue about his politics even. No one really cares.\n\nBut the likes of John McCain and Lindsey Graham are well known for being war mongers who are totally full of shit and useless. Rick Perry is a complete idiot. Hillary Clinton, well, she's a Clinton... Nuff said. And Donald Trump is the only person in the race (other than Bernie Sanders) who opposes the existing political paradigm. Rand Paul had a chance to do this, his father did. But Rand clearly embraced the political class. Ted Cruz recognizes why Trump is popular, and is seeking the same votes, and that is why he refuses to criticize him. But Ted Cruz is boring with a nasal voice, is a politician, and he clearly comes off as a total asshole. So Trump has the protest vote all locked up.\n\nBut what the political class and the American media don't understand is that they are truly hated. The media and political class are currently trying to kill Trump's campaign, but they are doing so at their own peril. Because trump is not just a Ralph Nader or Jessie Ventura or Ron Paul (true believers with limited potential), he is a billionaire who truly hates the political class. His platform (does he have one?) has nothing to do with policy ideas, but is purely a reactionary reflection of the popular hatred of the Washington elite. and this hatred runs very deep. it was deep enough to kill Hillary Clinton's campaign last time around against a candidate with the exact same political views (who even appointed her a key member of his cabinet), and it is powerful enough to truly disrupt the political order.\n\nTrump, more than any other candidate before him, has the potential to overthrow this political order, and that is why people support him. that is my view. change it.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Sure, it's okay to want to be able to support yourself and family, but protesting the government for a 15 dollar minimum wage seems to be the wrong way to approach it. If I understand the debate correctly, people want to the wage raised from the current $7.25 to $15 an hour. If this is the case, that means every fast food worker, sales associate and the vast many jobs that pay under 15 will now be 15, and I just can't see this being good for the economy. I see many many jobs being lost, job availability shrinking, getting a job becoming much much harder, and the infinite loop of \"I have no experience because I can't get a job because I have no experience...\" becoming much easier to fall into for kids entering the workforce. Along with the ever growing likelihood of some jobs being replaced by robots and other service gadgets, I can only imagine raising the minimum wage that much will be more harm than good.\n\nI also see making a fast food workers job livable an easy way out of putting in hard work. I'm not saying fast food is an easy job, but an entry level job that requires no skill shouldn't be a viable career choice. I read an article saying that fast food is an \"uncomfortable rung in the ladder\", that ladder leading to what a person wants to do with his/her life. Making that rung on the ladder a place you can stay, has to be more harm than good to the economy and American workforce though. Please CMV.\n\nEDIT: So my idea of jobs being negatively affected isn't as true as I thought and I'm just paranoid. I'm curious about alternatives to minimum wage raises though, I don't mean completely avoid doing, raising the wage to $10 dollars is a compromise I'm willing to make. What about other things to help people make a living though?\n\nDouble Edit: Thanks to /u/Crooooow and /u/kepold I now consider my view changed, I think my quarrels about the idea are more just paranoia than anything.

{"title": "CMV: Universities should not be required to adjudicate sexual assault claims.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3elbxd", "selftext": "It does not make sense for colleges and universities to be required to hold internal tribunals about criminal matters that happen on campus.  I see three principal reasons for this.\n\n* **Prosecuting crimes is the government's job.**\n\nThe government has the resources to meaningfully investigate crimes, the power to compel witnesses to testify, and institutions designed to handle criminal accusations.  Private prosecutions are considered an historical anachronism in free countries today.  \n\n* **Colleges are bad at it.**\n\nRelated to the first point, a college does not inherently have any of the resources or institutional structure to deal with a serious felony investigation.  They can't subpoena witnesses or records, they can't put people under oath, they don't have detectives or forensics labs or judges or professional prosecutors.\n\n* **Due Process matters.**\n\nThere are core due process rights that must be abided in a free country before punishing someone for an alleged crime.  These include but are not limited to: the right to confront and challenge one's accuser, the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, the right to compel witnesses to testify in your defense and to compel third parties to release evidence, the right to have legal counsel, and the right to a trial by a jury of your peers.  Colleges regularly flout all of these, and the proceedings much [more often resemble a kangaroo court than any real justice.](http://documents.latimes.com/uc-san-diego-sex-assault-case-ruling-doe-vs-regents-uc-san-diego/)\n\nUsing the force of law to require that universities adjudicate these claims is farcical.  If a private university wants to do something like this I suppose they can.  But a public university should not be able to sanction a student based on a criminal accusation without due process, and the government should not be forcing private institutions to do the same, [as they currently are doing](http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf).\n\n**Edit for clarification:**  This is not about whether universities should undetake some internal considerations, but about whether the existence and form of those internal proceedings should be dictated by the government as they currently are.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.\n\nI believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things.

{"title": "CMV: Film is a superior medium to theatre", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ek7fu", "selftext": "**My argument:**\n\nI *love* theatre. I'm an English teacher, and enjoy teaching plays just as much as teaching novels or poetry, and I focused my masters dissertation on Shakespearean tragedy. However, I believe that in many aspects, film is not only the natural successor to theatre as a storytelling tool, but also its superior. In many ways I see theatre as a rudimentary attempt to achieve the same things film does, but with greater limitations. I don't think there's any film made that's better than Macbeth, Hamlet or Othello, but I believe if film had been around as long as theatre, the masterworks of the former medium would have far surpassed that of the latter.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n \nFor starters, what does theatre do *better* than cinema? Anything involving audience interaction: definitely, though this is (I would argue) a minor thing in most genres, and the genres that make it a major thing tend to be abominable (like pantomime).  Theatre is also better whenever whatever story you present needs to be sufficiently artificial: so if you agree with Brecht and pooh-pooh the idea of suspension of disbelief, then theatre: a medium where you can literally always *see* the fakeness (the audience, the staging) is superior to film. And yet, there are films like Dogville which can still fulfil this same function. \n\nHowever, I would argue that in most cases, storytellers of fiction desire their audience to suspend their disbelief and 'believe in' the fictional world they have created: even if they're prepared to deliberately break this on occasion, as Shakespeare does. Tragedy wouldn't be tragic unless we believed in the characters it displayed. It could still be enjoyable (Like Oscar Wilde's absurdly artificial play Salome) but not tragic. Comedy is less slavish to suspension of disbelief and need for verisimilitude, but most comedies still strive for it to some degree. And here's the rub: *film is far superior to theatre in providing this aspect*. \n\nThere are so many limitations that theatre has to overcome in order to provide an experience the audience can 'believe in', and if it succeeds in overcoming these limitations, we are pulled out of the fiction because we are so impressed by how realistic the blood coming out of Banquo's mouth is, and if it fails at overcoming these limitations, we are pulled out of the fiction because the blood coming out of Banquo's mouth looks like watery food colouring. It's a lose-lose situation. In film however, when something looks sufficiently realistic so as to instil a sense of verisimilitude in its viewers: it more often than not bypasses that feeling of being impressed at the craftmanship of the artificial world, and instead bolsters our 'belief' in the fiction. Even if you know it's a miniature, you do not need to exert much mental strain to 'believe in' the skyline of L.A. in Blade Runner: it feels natural. Yet on the other hand, a scene change from one environment to another in theatre is jarring, and often when the lights come on we think to ourselves: *ah look: they've now lowered that chandelier that I saw in the previous scene, and they've put some white sheets over the furniture to show it's a different house*. A film can cut from a skyline to an interior shot, and even the most egregious of George Lucas wipe transitions won't break our sense of its natural flow.\n\n**In a nutshell, my argument is this:**\n\n1) The majority of storytellers in the majority of genres desire suspension of disbelief.\n\n2) Film overcomes various barriers which theatre for millennia has been forced to find ingenious workarounds to.\n\n3) When the hurdle of suspension of disbelief is easier to vault, more time, skill and energy can be spent actualising the artist's vision which strives to find beauty or truth.\n\n4) Therefore: film is, overall, the superior medium, and even in its infancy this new art form is already producing works that are starting to rival the greatest of plays. Had film been around as long as theatre, we would have as many 'master' filmmakers as we do writers.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

A personal mantra is 'one race, the human race'. IMHO nationalism is a scourge on society (perhaps we'd better save that for a future CMV).\n\nI'm English but feel as close kinship to Irish people as I do with Scottish &amp; Welsh people. Looking at my own family tree you don't have to go too far back to find plenty of Irish, Scottish &amp; Welsh relatives amongst the English.\n\nMany thanks to everyone for the carefully considered and thought provoking responses. Peace &amp; love upon you whether you happen to be British or Irish or anything else for that matter :)\n_________________________\n\n**Change my view : Irish people are British**\n\nBackground : A dear friend of mine is Irish, I\u2019m English.

This is the only time I\u2019ve heard her use the word cunt.\n\nI\u2019m aware there is a lot of controversy around this issue in Ireland, and have read about it fairly extensively, but I cannot accept the factual premise that Irish people are not British.\n\nTo me, to be British you have to be a citizen or native of a country within the British Isles. The island of Ireland is one of the British Isles and has been so since before the notion, never mind the nations, of England or Ireland even existed.\n\nThere does appear to be widespread ignorance that somehow confuses the term \u2018British\u2019 with the term \u2018English\u2019 or the island of Great Britain.\n\nIt seems very odd to me that Irish people would rather be identified by the English word \u2018Irish\u2019 than the ancient word \u2018British\u2019.\n\n\nTo some there seems to be a political meaning to the term \u2018British\u2019, whereas in my eyes it\u2019s a geographical term like \u2018European\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m fully aware that people are entitled to their own view on whether they are British or not, what they're not entitled to are their own facts.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you're a professional athlete, or an amateur competing in high profile tournaments such as the Olympics, then you either dope or you face a significant disadvantage.\n\nI don't think this will ever change, and the consequence is that every winner will be tainted by doubt, so I think the only way to address this is to change the policy to allow specific types of doping.\n\nBall-shrinking, liver wrecking, life endangering drugs would still be banned for the safety of the athlete, but anything that's either harmless (blood transfusions), or at the same level as \"professional hazard\" (like brain damage for boxers), would be allowed.\n\nOne of the things that encourage me to have this view, and that I'd like addressed if it's wrong, is my understanding that the IOC relaxed their criteria for gender verification. \n\nThe reason, as I understand it, is that there were simply too many legitimate side cases, so the hardline rule couldn't be enforced.

{"title": "CMV:If we are opposed to the prison industrial-complex... then perhaps shaming, shunning, and exile should be considered as alternatives.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ejxan", "selftext": "First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm \u2013 directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for.\n\nSubsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay.\n\nOne advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit.\n\nGranted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Now those of us who are \"fortunate\" enough to live in a 1st world nation ponder the meaning of our lives and the work we do.  We grasp for luxury that ultimately does nothing but pitch our fortune against others in a meaningless display of power.  Those left in the world who struggle to survive either do so against other humans, via the mechanics of capitalism or the horror of war, or they are admired and envied for the strength and longevity of their customs, for continuing to strike a balance with nature rather than using modern technologies to conquer it.\n\nTrue utopia is to face nature and face our mortality with acceptance, and to strike a balance with nature such that all life and life's labour has meaning.  We have lost this balance forever, and our ultimate fate is probably extinction dealt from our own hand. \n\nAnd of course, the great irony is that we are nature's impulses incarnate.  We are self-interested to a fault, as any natural life is.  We somehow just ended up with the intellectual power to win nature's game, and this is what will keep us from utopia."}

People balk at the idea of flying around in something filled with explosive gas, yet it seems to me that airliners, when they go wrong, are often just as (or more) fatal to their occupants. The Hindeburg disaster only killed just over a third of the people on board; the majority of airliner crashes kill everyone on board. Overall, the death toll of conventional airplanes, though small, has vastly exceeded that of airships, yet it is airships that retain the reputation of being death-traps. \n\nThe truth is, airships were an idea that was completely out of step with its times; during the period where they were most economically viable, materials and engine technology, among many other things, were barely adequate to deal with their demands. An airship built to Zeppelin scales with modern materials technology and design techniques would be dramatically stronger, lighter, faster and safer, with aramid fibre skins stretched over composite frames. They would have satellite navigation and meteorology, and onboard weather radar to avoid dangerous weather; computerised systems would monitor hydrogen pressure and static build-ups, modern escape and fire suppression systems would provide a final back-up. Moreover, there is the potential to use solar power and electric motors to run these flying behemoths essentially for free, making them far more economically viable, both for passengers who don't mind a slower, more stately trip and for container cargo. You might even be able to use onboard generated power to crack water to produce hydrogen to replenish losses, though I'm not sure how feasible that would be.\n\nAlso, it's very hard to deny that airships are really fucking cool.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It\u2019s an experience of systematic, frequent, and legal rape, beating, murder, torture, kidnapping, cruel working conditions and constant verbal dehumanization.  For hundreds of years.   Even after slavery ended officially in 1865, much of this continued for another 100 years, well into our lifetimes.  Since slavery ended, the Black experience has included beatings, murder, burning crosses, vandalism, and intimidation and humiliation at lunch counters, drinking fountains, public streets, private homes, work places and the voting booth.   It has included de jure and de facto exclusion from decent neighborhoods, home loans, schools, adequate jobs, political representation, legal justice in courtrooms, and even marriage to White people (until 1967).  While increasingly less legal, much of this continues today, as does the fallout and trauma of coming from 12 or more generations of abuse.\n\nBlack people\u2019s bodies \u2013 literally and figuratively \u2013 tilled the soil, built the foundation, and grew the backbone of this country.  They planted and harvested crops that fed us and grew White wealth.  They built the roads and railroads.  They nursed and cared for White children so wealthy White women could spend time doing other things like studying and developing their artistic talents. And on and on.  And we have yet to truly acknowledge that White people are rich \u2013 that White America is rich \u2013 because Black people did so much to build this nation, and built it for cheap or less than nothing.\n\nThe life you enjoy today is also made easier by the fact that you was born with White skin in a country where having White skin has brought meaningful, unearned advantages for hundreds of years.  And yet so many White people think racism is gone, over, a moot point, or a tiresome topic.  They point to all the progress we\u2019ve made and how much better things are.  Yes, you've made progress and things are better \u2013 but this was just as much (or more) due to Black peoples\u2019 efforts as yours. \n\nNothing in White people\u2019s experience comes close to the suffering of Black people.  Nothing.  And you inflicted this suffering.  White people owe Black people a tremendous debt \u2013 still unpaid. That is why White people have the responsibility to pay back their debt to black people after 200 years. Black people shouldn't be asking for $15 minimum wage or equal pay, affirmative action or stop police brutality, White people should be automatically, happily and voluntarily give black people double the minimum wage, extra pay and give up their slots in college for black people, as well as give black people reduced sentences for their crime. Think that's unfair? NO, that's fair, because you and your race owe black people an immeasurable amount of wealth, opportunity and happiness that you should start paying back. Everything that you have to enjoy today is thanks to black people's effort. You already owe black people since you're born white.

While I do think the farms were collectivized way too fast, for the most part the crimes the communist states committed had more to do with their authoritarian and ideological rigidity than with people starving because they \"ran out of other people's money\" as conservatives like to quip.\n\nThere's nothing inherent about socialism that means you have to kill off your opponents or commit genocide, or censor the media and throw dissidents in prison. This is a result of the largest communist states being one-party ruled, and an overly vengeful culture and government. Capitalist dictatorships of the 20th century like Pinochet's Chile and Suharto's Indonesia were the exact same way in this regard. \n\nOne can have both communism and democracy - Mongolia, Nepal and Albania all democratically elected communist parties in the 90s. I just don't see anything wrong with distributing the wealth, especially when you consider the positive track record of such attempts in mixed economics like the Nordic countries, Australia and Canada. \n\nI'd even argue that for all of the bad things Soviet Russia and Red China did, they were still much better than the monarchies that came beforehand. They also did see a lot of economic growth and development. Before the Communists Russia and China were backwaters, practically medieval societies. By the 80s they were very well developed and the majority of the population lived relatively modern lifestyles with radios, electricity, healthcare (not necessarily the best, but given non-discriminately and vastly better than what was available in the 19th century), television sets (even if they were mostly B&amp;W), universal education and running water. It's hard to deny that communism was a success in the sense of material prosperity growing.\n\nSo I fail to see why communism is inferior to capitalism, aside from the fact that nationalist movements ultimately destroyed the Soviet Union. You could also argue that Japan and America's unending economic stagnation represents a failure of capitalism, and it would make just as much sense.\n\nI think the best system is one that mixes capitalism and communism together - that allows innovation and makes it easy for people to start enterprises, but also has a strong publicly owned \"backbone\" and distributes wealth so that the poor do not starve or end up homeless, and the rich and middle class live in a more stable and safe society, which is the case when you have fewer people who are desperate and irrational due to poverty.\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Bruno Mars - Uptown Funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPf0YbXqDm0) \n* [Kendrick Lamar - Alright](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-48u_uWMHY)\n\nNow here's [Anaconda.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDZX4ooRsWs)\n\nHere are the claims as to why she didn't get nominated for the award:\n\n1. **She's a black woman**: She forgets that Beyonc\u00e9 was nominated as well. One could argue that Beyonce's music video doesn't focus on black women, as her little entourage has much lighter skinned women than her, but so does the Anaconda music video. Kendrick lamar's music video features primarily minority groups, and the few roles reserved for white people are in the place of antagonists (murderous police, for example). Uptown Funk, though mostly men, has Bruno Mars and his minority backup dancers taking up most of the screentime. I think to say there's a racist or sexist bias in the music video selection is ignoring every other nomination.\n\n2. **She's not skinny**: [Nicki Minaj isn't skinny?](http://www.lovebscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/article-2707980-200CC11600000578-259_634x837.jpg) Tell me one man who would say she's not skinny. Sure, she doesn't have the frame of a clothing model, but she's far from \"fat.\" In her own words, \"*If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year*.\" Kendrick Lamar's music video doesn't focus on women very much at all. Uptown Funk doesn't either. Ed Sheeran's music video only feature's one woman, and in a very monogamous way; if she's being celebrated for anything, it's the dexterity and elegance of her dancing. The women in Beyonc\u00e9's music video aren't exactly model frame either. In fact, they're pretty close in stature to Nicki's entourage. The only music video this must be applicable to is Taylor Swift's, but saying that some feature is the path to music video of the year, when only 1 out of the 5 music videos nominated might have it is absurd. I doubt that with skinnier dancers, Anaconda would get any closer to the nomination.\n\n3. **Her music video influenced a culture and MTV is purposefully ignoring its popularity**: This one is really based on a few different subjective factors, but I wouldn't say Anaconda \"influenced\" a culture, more or less [produced](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/850/039/01d.png) [a](https://lolclt.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/nicki-minaj-rocket-launch-meme.jpg?w=500) [lot](http://ocdn.hiphopdx.com/nickiminaj-anaconda2.png) [of](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/46504681373641436/6E722B950FC6B4E5FAB09AD36BBB256F24B103D6/?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;output-format=jpeg&amp;output-quality=95&amp;fit=inside%7C500:418&amp;composite-to=*,*%7C500:418&amp;background-color=black) [memes](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/803/384/d6d.jpg) that poke fun at the absurdity of the music video and song. None of these things are \"influencing a culture,\" other than giving millions of people a new buzz-generating piece of controversial entertainment. And the music video is popular, and for a period of time, you would hear about it a lot. But at the end of the day, the video was published last August, almost a whole year ago, and has around 489 million views. In 2 months, Bad Blood has garnered over 362 million views. Kendrick's Alright has over 10 million views in 3 weeks. Thinking Out Loud has 662 million views. Uptown Funk reigns supreme with 867 million views. 7/11 is in the same ballpark as Anaconda, being published only 3 months after and only getting 241 million views. But even the most viewed music video on YouTube, Gangnam Style, didn't get nominated at the VMA's the year it came out, nor did the one before it, Justin Bieber's \"Baby.\" It's not like the VMA's are snubbing Nicki Minaj altogether; she's been nominated for Best Female Video and Best Hip-Hop Video, a category where she's the only woman represented.\n\nIn short, I think the decision to not include Nicki Minaj was on merit alone. MTV hasn't shown a bias against women or minorities, and they're not singling Nicki out on her own by pulling her completely out of the awards. The reason her music video maybe wasn't nominated for the Best Video could be anything. I personally don't think it's worth being called \"Best Music Video of 2015.\" Maybe they thought it was too frenetic, goofy, and slightly incoherent to warrant being called the BEST music video. And that's fair for them to do, as the ones who select the nominees.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: X is better than Y", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ecjmj", "selftext": "Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. \n\n1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to \"why.\"\n\n2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in \"ly\" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.\n\n3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. \n\n4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). \n\n5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. \n\n6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. \n\n7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. \n\n8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even \"American History X.\"\n\n9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, \n\n10. = X. \n\n11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. \n\n12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say \"X is better than Y,\" never \"Y is better than X\". \n\n\nEDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: A shrinking population size is a good thing", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ec84d", "selftext": "If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result(s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement?\n\nEdit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view."}
{"title": "CMV: Jack of All Trades and a Master of None is Better than a Master of One", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ebxxu", "selftext": "We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None.  I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a \"master\" at some skill or aspect of your life.  \n\nWhat I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few \"trades\".\n\nFor starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age.  The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life.  It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.  \n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most.  It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most.  Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age.  Is \"success\" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task?  The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make.   \n\nA Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis.  For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is \"good\" at many things and a Master is \"great\" at one thing.  When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life.  I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example.  I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed.  I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors.  Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like.  However, he spends at least 60+ hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work.  At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night.   \n\nI try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task.  As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing.  The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day.  I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English.  I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time.  Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way.  So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things.  \n\nPlease don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic.  This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand.\n\nI am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice.         \n\n**Edit** \nHere is the delta, thanks **AnecdotallyExtant**\n\n&gt;I will change your view with a single diagram.\nIt will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all.\nAs an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house -- nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid.\nSo again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity.\nWhich means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all.\n\nPlease read below if you want to see the diagram.  Many others had the same argument, but you approached it from an angle that makes sense.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: What we most hate in others are traits we have, and hate, in ourselves", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ebqsa", "selftext": "This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says \"I hate X\" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.\n\nAn important distinction: I'm talking about \"hate\" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**\n\nWhen people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires. This has become a running joke among gay acceptance (i.e. decent) people.\n\nWhen people say they hate intolerance, you'll often find they're very intolerant of views that strike them as incorrect or un-PC.\n\nNow, take something horrendously evil like pederasty/paedophilia. One of the most heinous, evil, horrible acts possible. Most people I know, however, when asked what they hate in people, don't really mention acts like that. They mention less horrifically evil things: I hate bullies, I hate hypocrisy, I hate rudeness. \n\nWe may want to kill a convicted paedophile with our bare hands, but during our day to day lives we don't think about them often or say we \"hate\" them--we save our long-term hatreds for less evil things. (This may simply be because (say) pedos are so rare and don't show up in our lives very often, or, because people don't hate that which isn't in their own psychological repertoire, or a mixture of both.)\n\nWhen I say \"I hate religious extremists\", I don't have to be religious to say it, but the underlying trait I hate may be closed-mindedness, which I may hate in myself and which I am afraid of exhibiting. I am 100% convinced I do not have a closed mind, but I cannot easily prove it. Do diehard atheists disprove the idea that what we hate most we hate in ourselves? I also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.\n\nIs it all just pop psych bs? I would like a good argument against the idea that our common/over-time objects of hate--particularly a character trait in other people--does not necessarily reflect a hatred of those traits in yourself and a fear that you will express them.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: There is nothing wrong with requiring (medically-appropriate) vaccination for children to attend public schools", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3eai2b", "selftext": "Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:\n\n1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.\n\n2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.\n\n3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...\n\n4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.\n\nWhat would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.\n\nEdit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it \"should have\" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.\n\nEdit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.\n\nEdit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow. If it blows up, I might not get to everyone, but I will try to address any new points that are brought to the table."}

Let Marines keep 1% of whatever they confiscate ($320 billion), let the DoD keep 5% ($1.6 Trillion) and tell them to use it to stop all future tax haven schemes, let 4% go to foreign aid to pay off the complaining countries and let others in on the deal to make sure it's popular internationally ($1.3 Trillion).  \n\nThen you have 90% left.  Let 53% go to zeroing out the total US government debt ($17 trillion).  Now you have 37% left.  Let 7% of it ($2.2 Trillion) go to rebuilding infrastructure.  You still have 30% left.

It's estimated that $900 billion of it is owed in taxes to the US anyways.  There's no reason to be utilizing these havens if you're obeying the letter and spirit of the law.\n\nEven if we just went after taxes due and issued sanctions, we'd get a cool trillion out of it, which could be used to great effect.\n\nWhy are we just leaving all this money in crooked little unarmed taxhavens without putting up a fight?\n\nIran never robbed us for hundreds of billions of dollars.

{"title": "CMV: Life is shit", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3e96ml", "selftext": "o* \nLife is shit. We're all going to die. Most of us are forced to work a 9-5 job we don't enjoy in order to put bread on the table. Over 40% of people in the UK will suffer cancer at some point. 900 million starving people in the world (but thanks to huge inequality and pure dumb luck you're not one of them). Studies have found that most of us would rate ourselves as \"happy\" or \"very happy\", but we're engineered to be overly-optimistic about our lives because an optimistic organism has better inclusive fitness; it is more inclined to \"try, try and try again\" until it breeds. Studies have found people tend to over-estimate the quality of their lives. Most people - even those living in poverty - must lie to themselves and others that their lives are worth living because the alternative would be to either face the cognitive dissonance that arises from continuing a life they believe is not worth continuing, or to kill themselves.\nOur lives are devoid of meaning. Most people recognise that life objectively has no meaning, but go down the existentialist route of inventing some subjective bullshit reason to delude themselves that their lives are significant in some way. Some particularly introspective people will eventually come up against the Absurd - recognising the paradox of their being as an individual that desires meaning but finding themselves in a world devoid of any. Zapffe states we try to avoid dealing with this by \"artificially limiting the contents of our consciousness\" using the psychological defensive techniques of distraction, anchoring, isolation and sublimation. Our brains are constantly trying to bullshit ourselves, and for many people it works most of the time, but at times it fails.\n\"What about the happiness in life?\" What about it? According to Schopenhauer, what we call \"happiness\" is a \"negative\" (i.e. derivative) quantity, a label we attribute to the relative absence of suffering, which is the \"positive\" (i.e. real) element of existence. This is why the pleasures you experience are always less pleasurable than you expect, and the pains always considerably more painful.\nBesides, even if you somehow find a true source of happiness, it wouldn't last. If there's one certainty in life beside death, it's the impermanence of all things. This is a truth recognised not only by Schopenhauer but in Buddhism as one of its core principles. It has a special name for the kind of suffering associated with our recognition of this impermanence of the state of affairs: Viparinama-dukkha. You enjoy your life now? In the best case, you're going to grow old and decrepid, and then die. Your significant other is going to die. Your pet cats and dogs are going to die. You'll get sick. You'll get hit by a car. You'll end unemployed. The economy will turn. So the takeaway is that happiness in a world like ours is fleeting at best, non-existent at worst. \"In a world where all is unstable, and nought can endure, but is swept onwards at once in the hurrying whirlpool of change; where a man, if he is to keep erect at all, must always be advancing and moving, like an acrobat on a rope \u2014 in such a world, happiness in inconceivable. How can it dwell where, as Plato says, continual Becoming and never Being is the sole form of existence? In the first place, a man never is happy, but spends his whole life in striving after something which he thinks will make him so; he seldom attains his goal, and when he does, it is only to be disappointed; he is mostly shipwrecked in the end, and comes into harbor with masts and rigging gone. And then, it is all one whether he has been happy or miserable; for his life was never anything more than a present moment always vanishing; and now it is over.\"\nAnd then we have Professor David Benatar, who explains in Better Never to Have Been that \"a life filled with good and containing only the most minute quantity of bad\u2014a life of utter bliss adulterated only by the pain of a single pin-prick\u2014is worse than no life at all\". He demonstrates that, due to an asymmetry that exists between the values of suffering and happiness when comparing situations that entail a transition from a state of non-existence to existence, every single one of us was overall harmed by being born.\nWhy do we exist? We're biological machines put together by our constituent genes to serve their interests by acting as vessels through which they can proliferate while having a measure of protection from their environment and the machines of competitor genes. We're engineered, like all life, to survive and breed effectively within our environments. It in the interest of these genes to wire our brains to believe our lives are meaningful and worth continuing however bullshit this might be because pessimists and nihilists tend to be far less inclined to survive and reproduce.\n\"Wretched, ephemeral race, children of chance and tribulation, why do you force me to tell you the very thing which it would be most profitable for you not to hear? The very best thing is utterly beyond your reach: not to have been born, not to be, to be nothing. However, the second best thing for you is: to die soon.\" -- Aristotle, The Wisdom of Silenus"}

Maybe I'm missing something here, and I hope you guys can help change my mind.\n\nSo, in my view, corporations don't actually have to care about anyone. All they care about is money. They are businesses, they exist to make a profit. Absolutely nobody should be surprised by this. They don't have a moral obligation to help anybody or be compassionate or think of the children or any of that stuff. Businesses don't have a heart, just two columns of numbers.\n\nInsurance companies only exist to make money. The way they do that is by investing in different people, at different rates, to end up making more money than they spend. The perfect customer from their perspective is one who pays their bill every month and never gets sick or costs them money. The worst customer is one who is constantly sick and costs them a ton of money.\n\nSo when a young, smart, healthy, middle class person comes in for insurance, he's probably a good investment. Odds are, he will make his payments, and probably not develop any serious issues. A safe bet.\n\nNow you have an obese smoker with asthma, poor eyesight, a heart murmur, epilepsy, diabetes, and leprosy, and he wants insurance. Guess what pal? You are a terrible investment! The odds of you earning the company more money than you cost is almost zero. He's a terrible bet and no sane employee should even consider giving this person insurance.\n\nI understand this means these people can't get insurance, but that's not the companies problem.

{"title": "CMV: Statistical Thermodynamical Basis for the existence of God through Entropy", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3e7xe9", "selftext": "Hello! I recently saw a CMV on an argument of the probability of the existence of God or Extraterrestial Life. I had posted a comment but no one has replied so I figured I would post my own CMV. Basically I am relating science and religion.\n\n\nThere is a statistical basis for God that gives an absolute definition for God's existence and that can be explained through statistical thermodynamics and entropy. Thermodynamics is a powerful science that is deeply underrated because it has evolved into the science of defining what is possible and impossible.\n\n\nI will try to explain entropy to the best of my ability but it requires a fundamental knowledge of the Laws of Thermodynamics. But the Second Law states that the entropy of the universe must always increase for any (natural) irreversible process (or be equal to zero for processes at equilibrium). I claim these irreversible processes \"natural\" simply because they exist in nature without any perturbation of an outside intelligent force. But the proper scientific term would be \"isolated\" when referring to the system in question. Now entropy is defined as the \"measure of randomness or disorder\". This concept is hard to grasp because it requires the definition of two terms \"macrostates\" and \"microstates\".\n\n\nThe best way for one to explain this is through the statistics of dice. There are 11 possible outcomes once rolled (2-12) and these represent the macrostates. However there are many ways to represent a set of the numbers (or macrostate), say macrostate(5) = 1+4....2+3...3+2...4+1 (assuming distinguishable dice). Now each set of the dice outcome (1+4 or 2+3...etc) represents a microstate. Now if we rolled the dice infinite times what would the results look like? A perfect bell curve right? With 7 the highest and 2/12 the lowest. Why is this? because 7 has the highest number of possibilities (or microstates) (1+6...2+5...3+4...etc) and 2 or 12 have the lowest (1+1 or 6+6, respectively). Thus the Second Law can be defined that \"An isolated system tends toward an equilibrium macrostate with maximum entropy, because then the number of microstates is the largest and this state is statistically most probable.\" This matches with physical observations. Think of an ice in a perfect crystal lattice where all the atoms are arranged in a lattice becomes in a thermal equilibrium with the environment. It begins to melt and move around increasing the possible arrangements in the liquid state. The atomic arrangement increases and therefore the entropy of the system is increasing as the water changes states. (similar argument for liquid to gas).\n\n\nThere is an argument that entropy can be a viable definition for the passage of time because any spontaneous process goes from an ordered state to a more disordered state. In other words, one with more macrostates and possible outcomes. In the case of the previous examples, before you roll the dice, there exists only one microstate, where there is no value of the dice right? (because you haven't rolled it duh) Then you roll the dice and open up the possibilities. Therefore the process goes from holding the dice in your hand with only one state (ordered) to actually rolling it opening up 36 possibilities (more disorder). Same with transfer of thermal energy from the hotter (or possesses more thermal energy) environment to the ice for it to melt. Energy cannot transfer from the ice to the environment because the ice possesses less potential energy. Heat always flows from hot to cold. Never the reverse.\n\n\nNow what does this have to do with God? Well imagine the entire passage of time of the universe, where the universe is always increasing entropy (i.e. going from order to disorder). Now imagine going back in time, where things go from disorder to order (dice go in your hand or reverse heat flow from ice to environment). Reverse time in your head all the way to the Big Bang, where there can only exist ONE PERFECT STATE and that is God. The whole universe and everything in physical existence in one perfectly ordered state and that is God. That is the basis of God being omnipotent because he is literally everything and in everywhere. Then there was a Big Bang and the Universe was created (compare to Genesis 1 in the Bible). The \"Universe Clock\" started and the perfect state proceeded towards a more disordered state.\n\n\nThinking of this thermodynamically, God is the unnatural action of going from disorder to order. Therefore, God is order. God is considered \"supernatural\" because he is a force different than that in the physical world where entropy is violated. Now, the Bible claimed that \"God created life\" and this can be proven true. Life is a statistically improbable result from physics. But it arose from a perfect condition and arrangement of molecules that somehow produced an well-ordered organism. (There is a theory that Earth before all life was basically a barren wasteland of gasses and electric storms which the lightning produced enough energy for the gasses to arrange perfectly and organized perfectly). Statistically speaking, life shouldn't even exist because it is ordered perfectly that it is extremely improbable. The example my physical chemistry professor gave is that if you gave a monkey a type writer and trained it to punch a bunch of random letters, what is the probability that it will type out the whole entire encyclopaedia? However, I do not disagree with the possibility that other life (aliens or whatever) exists because there is always a possibility (The Black Swan Theory) but we might as well have a better chance with monkeys and typewriters. Also I have found a paper in which relates the origins of life and entropy: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06988v1.pdf\n\n\nAlso, the Bible claimed that \"God created man under the image of himself\". This shouldn't be taken literally because we don't ACTUALLY look like God but the original interpretation is that we are, in some ways, Godlike. I say this because we do things that are against entropy because we have intelligence. Well actually all life has some degree of intelligence but there are levels. The most fundamental act against entropy that all life possess is that life exists and strive to continue to exist. We (as in all life, plants, animals, cells, humans...) are highly ordered structures that are the result of disorder becoming ordered and we continue to exist! Not only do we continue to exist but it is a biological concern for us to continue living and reproduce. Merely producing babies or more life is an act against entropy because we are continuing to make more ordered structures. The thing that separates humans from the rest of life is that we have a higher level of intelligence in that we are smart enough to interact with the environment and one another to a higher degree. Think about this, if there was a bunch of random metals laying on the Earth, what is the probability that it will become the Eiffel Tower? That required the work of man. Paraphrasing the Bible again (sorry just justifying Christians and Catholics) \"God made man the rulers of His creation\" We are the masters of craft, creating wonderful structures and arts. We created civilizations which are highly ordered organizations. This is what people meant when they said math is the language of God and engineers are craftsman of God. They create ordered things which require a level of intelligence that is parallel to God.\nHowever, we still need to keep entropy in mind. The entropy of the universe must go from order to disorder but it can be broken up into two parts: the entropy of a system in question and the entropy of everything else or surroundings. If we create something whether it be a building, a computer or whatever, we are making a higher ordered system but we are still increase the disorder of the universe by opening up more possibilities. Buildings allow more physical space for the rest of the environment to use or computers open up more possibilities (faster chips, software, internet).\n\n\nI have been toying with this idea for the past year and I would love to for someone to change my view.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Therefore, if a victim of child abuse learns that images of their abuse is being viewed online, then every person after the creator of the image is responsible for that image still existing, since they have created copies and re-distributed them.\n\nSomeone who has viewed the image (so downloaded it) but not re-distributed it, cannot be said to be responsible for the fact the image existed when they found it, or that it continues to exist after they downloaded it. Unless the person viewing the image pays to view it or offers a person some sort of benefit in kind other than money, such as for example praise, then him being a passive consumer has, in my opinion, absolutely no impact on the existence of the image on a distribution network. \n\nA person who views an image of child abuse is only responsible for their behaviour and not the behaviour of others who might view and distribute the same image. A good test of whether harm is caused by a passive consumer of child pornography is to take that passive consumer out of the equation and assess whether the same amount of harm is suffered by the victim. Since passive viewing does not impact upon the existence of the image, if you were able to stop every person who ever passively views but does not re-distribute an image, the image would still exist. The number of people viewing and re-distributing the images would still be the same and they would all still be liable for the harm if the victim in the image was to find out that images of their abuse were being viewed. \n\nPlease don't try and change my view by telling me how bad child porn is, I don't need to be told. My view could quite as easily be about any other topic, except that this appears to me to be the only case where harm is often attributed even though the causal link is broken.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The illusion of a flickery alternate world breaks down when the motion is as smooth as reality. The viewer more readily perceives actors in makeup on sets. It all just looks... fake. Any film in HFR, either filmed at 48 or interpolated on a TV, looks like a cheap soap opera.\n\nI recently bought a PS4. GTA V looks WORSE than it did on the PS3. The draw distance is better, there are less pop-ins, but the frame rate is too high. Everything looks smooth and fake and video gamey. Flying over the city reminds me of playing N64, because I can't see Los Santos. I just see a bunch of polygons and textures and shaders. Actors in makeup on sets. *EDIT: GTA5 runs at 30fps on PS4. Why does it look worse? Why does it feel more fake? Is the falseness of everything just... clearer?*\n\nI just wish there was a way to limit the frame rate to 24 or 30. It would look fantastic.\n\nBut I keep hearing people say they NEED 60fps! I don't know why this is but I have some guesses:\n\n1. Gamers want that hyper reality. Video games and live action film are two completely different mediums, so games are expected to (or at least allowed to) look different. There is something about that false smoothness that is appealing to a gamer. It makes something look \"video gamey\".\n\n2. Is it more of a PC thing? As a way to show off? A high frame rate means the computer is powerful/expensive. It gives the user a feeling that their machine is worth the money? I don't know.\n\n3. It increases gamer performance? Does it have something to do with getting the slightest advantage when playing other people? Do gamers with the highest refresh rates perform better? Does getting the most headshots mean more than enjoying an immersive experience?\n\nI suppose that's the sticking point: immersion. A high frame rate does not immerse me in a video game. It does the opposite.\n\n(NB This is my view of games on a rectangular screen; I've never tried a modern VR like Oculus. HFR is probably critical with that.)"}

{"title": "CMV: Google Is The Most Powerful Company In The Western World, And It Could Become Problematic", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3e76dy", "selftext": "While Google may not have the highest market cap, I'm strongly convinced that their owned services provide them an enormous amount of power-not necessarily just for economic gain, but also for political and social gain. \n\nThey control the most widely used search engine in the western world. While a search engine isn't the internet as a whole(iCANN essentially controls DNS, a number of organizations control IP distribution), controlling this search engine means that Google essentially controls the most widely used portal to the internet.(in other words, they control how you navigate the internet)\n\nIn modern society, when people want to look up something, they usually \"Google\" it. Google then displays what is considers the most widely relevant and significant results, in the way it is programmed to do. As a search engine, Google reserves the ability to tweak this engine in any way they see fit. Google essentially controls what results make the front page of a search.\n\nIn theory, Google controls the information that is provided to the user. If a user looks up a controversial issue, Google could in theory manipulate the results to provide information in favor of 1 side.\n\nIn recent years, Google has begun censoring it's search results. You can see /r/googlecensorship if you don't believe it. \n\n**Examples of censored content include:**\n\n- Removal of websites that illegally stream copyrighted material from search results(Google isn't legally required to block these as they aren't hosting the content).\n\n- Potentially offensive, but legal anime content.\n\n- Recent removal of confederate flag from shopping category\n\n\nThese are just a few examples of the content Google has censored. I'm not for or against the content they censor, there's reasons for doing so, and reasons not to, I'm simply demonstrating that Google has the potential to skew search results, and has actively done so in the past.\n\n**Google essentially controls the #1 public information source in the world.** While some people may be smart enough to seek out credible sources instead of Googling, it still provides them the capability to sway the public majority in the way they see fit. In a democratic world, being able to sway the majority of people essentially makes you the most powerful entity in the world.\n\nYou may wonder, but where could this go wrong? As of now, Google is only censoring content that can be considered offensive or illegal, and trying to make the user feel guilty for pursuing it by skewing their search results to make the top results content that convinces the user to change their beliefs/habits.\n\nBut where could this take us? Imagine if the US Government got involved in a huge war. Google could, in theory, be forced by the US government to skew search results to improve public support of the war. Google could in theory kick anti-war webpages/blogs off of the search results, and skew news results to primarily contain propaganda.\n\nIf you don't believe me, look at Baidu. As a prominent web services company in China, they're partially responsible for the widespread censorship of their internet(likely pressured by the government).\n\nOf course, surely something like this would never happen to the US, a glorious free country with freedom of speech, right? That would be true, if freedom of speech was maintained. The first amendment is merely an empty promise that exists to create a sense of nationalistic pride. It has been broken so many times in the past in order to maintain war support and for other reasons. It's essentially \"freedom of speech, except when we don't want you to have it\".\n\nWhether its newspapers, the radio, or television, the government has censored the media countless times to maintain support for a war. It's not unreasonable to expect for the government to make that effort on the internet. History repeats itself, it would be foolish to think this wouldn't happen in the event of a huge war. The only difference would be that the internet is difficult to censor as a whole-but that won't matter, because the government only needs to censor what the majority can reach. China's censorship works just fine for them in swaying the public despite there being a million loopholes, so it would for the US too.\n\nAnd besides governments and war, there's plenty of other ways Google could abuse their power. They essential have the power to manipulate their users by controlling what information is fed to them.\n"}

This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had a chance to really share my view on because it's sort of a \"taboo\" view to have.\n\nTo sum up the r/relationships post: OP's 4 year old son is severely autistic and OP has been told by doctors that his son will never function above the level of a 1 year old and will require constant care. Son is ruining OP's life and marriage, and is negatively affecting OP's 2 young daughters as well.\n\nI do not believe the OP of that post, and the many other parents who are in a similar scenario, deserve to have their lives ruined just because they were \"dealt a bad hand\" and ended up with a disabled child.

I don't see a fundamental difference between the two cases.\n\nAs for government-owned care facilities: I don't believe it is a good use of our resources as a society to continue to take care of individuals who have no chance to ever become functional members of society. Euthanasia is a much more economically and environmentally more efficient option.\n\nWhat won't change my view: slippery slope/\"where do we draw the line\" types of arguments. We are only discussing cases in which the child is beyond a shadow of a doubt unable to ever function independently.

Even if it isn't tethered to your phone, it still pales in comparison to an actual phone and I can't see the long term appeal of having one in lieu of a smartphone.

Once AR glasses are A) stylish enough and B) useful enough and once they reach a critical mass of users, whatever stigmas surrounding them will gradually disappear. Even before AR glasses are capable of much by way of introducing three dimensional objects into the world in a realistic fashion, just the appeal of having a floating screens/UI elements in front of one's face that one could interact with in a variety of ways should have a lot of appeal.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway, back on topic: why should I take smartwatches seriously?\u00a0"}

I have an issue with transgender people saying that they are born with a [gendered] brain in a [wrong gendered] body. For many years women have been fighting for equality with men and in this light it is abhorrent to say that men and women have brains that are different. Feminists (both men and women) have fought hard to erase the entrenched beliefs of a patriarchal society. For example, to be a male yet be interested in feminine things and FEEL feminine is only upholding the belief that there are certain traits unique to and can only be possessed by females. This is the premise to my argument so bear with me. \n\n\n\nAlas, as stated above, I believe that being transgender can be one's own way (subconsciously) to mentally rebel against society's very deep and entrenched gender roles. \n\n\n\n-Secondly, I see thoughts of transgender individuals to be patterned similarly to the thoughts of individuals with the mental illness known as body dysmorphic disorder. Persons with BDD tend to have an obsession with a certain part of their body or facet of their personality that they blow out of proportion to reality. This obsession causes sufferers a great deal of emotional pain and can lead them to take extreme measures to remedy the perceived problem. Most people with BDD are adolescents. \n\nFor example, someone with BDD may be so obsessed with the shape of their nose that they seek surgery to reduce their concern and obsession. However, surgery is not a treatment for BDD. BDD is a manifestation of extreme anxiety and depression and fixing the obsession does not remove said mental illnesses from the person. Most individuals who do go to extreme measures as such tend to continue experience the anxiety and depression that manifested itself as an obsession with the shape of their nose.\n\n\n-Now, in that vein how are we to say that the plight of transgender people is any different? Feelings of extreme anxiety and depression directed at the person's gender, correction of gender and not a lot of resolution with the underlying mental illness.\n\n\nSee this study: [Long-Term Follow-Up of Transsexual Persons Undergoing Sex Reassignment Surgery: Cohort Study in Sweden.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3043071/) Research has shown that \"Persons with transsexualism, after sex reassignment, have considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population. Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group.\" \n\n\n\n\nThis is my case.

{"title": "CMV: Bernie Sanders is at least as electable as Hillary Clinton.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3e3iqi", "selftext": "I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power to help make sure the next two SCOTUS nominations are not controlled by the GOP, end of story. \n\nThat being said, there seems to be this idea that Clinton would be a lock for the presidency but, if Sanders were to get the Democratic nomination, it becomes possible or even *likely* that the GOP will take the presidency. If that were *true*, then it would behoove me to support Clinton in the primaries, if I really am committed, above all else, to keeping the GOP from taking the presidency in 2016.\n\nMy primary reason for believing that Bernie Sanders is *at least* as electable in the general as Hillary Clinton (I actually think he's *more* electable, but that's immaterial to this CMV) is a set of thought experiments, which simply revolve around considering the behavior of individuals/groups voting (or abstaining) in 2008/2012, how that behavior would respond to Hillary being the nominee, and how that response would be *altered* by having Bernie as the nominee instead. For ease of illustration, I'm going to use Jeb Bush as the stand-in/proxy for the eventual Republican presidential nominee - if you think the GOP will likely nominate someone else, and it will make a difference in how a significant number of people vote (or abstain), feel free to specify why/how in your reply, and then proceed within the context of your chosen Republican presidential nominee.\n\n-----\n\nSo, here are some examples of the general form of the thought experiment - this set of examples is, by no means, comprehensive, but I've yet to think of one which significantly advantages Hillary over Bernie:\n\n * Describe to me the person or demographic, who voted for Obama in 2012, who would vote for Hillary over Jeb in 2016, but who would vote for Jeb over Bernie in 2016. (Impacts: Swing votes)\n \n  * Now describe to me the opposite group (Bernie&gt;Jeb&gt;Hillary) - which group seems larger?\n\n * Describe to me the apathetic Democrat who, once they are familiar with Bernie as a candidate, is more energized by Hillary than Bernie. (Impacts: Democrat turnout, i.e. harmful abstentions)\n \n  * Now describe to me the opposite group - which seems larger?\n\n * Describe to me the Republican who would make it to the polls to vote against Bernie, but would be like \"meh, fuck it\" and not bother to vote against Hillary. (Impacts: Republican turnout, i.e. helpful abstentions)\n\n-----\n\nNow, outside of that form of argument, one thing I've seen cited as evidence against Bernie in this respect is a particular Gallup poll, regarding attitudes towards those who identify as socialist:\n\n&gt;For years, Gallup's been asking the following question: \"If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be X, would you vote for that person?\" \n\n&gt;In the most recent iteration of that (from June 2-7), [respondents were least likely to say yes when \"X\" was \"socialist\"](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx) at 47%. More respondents said they'd vote for an atheist (58%) or a Muslim (60%).\n\nMy problem with that is as follows:\n\nEvery one of those descriptors, except for socialist, is a largely apolitical identity - whereas being \"a socialist\" is a political ideology.\n\nThe phrase \"just happened to be [black/Muslim/Jewish/a woman]\" implies that the nominee would have said identity, but would still mostly follow the tenets of whatever \"your party\" was - whereas \"just happened to be [a socialist]\" implies an ideological leaning that potentially conflicts with whatever you feel \"your party\" stands for.\n\nTherefore, comparing the numbers for \"a socialist\" to all those other identity-based descriptors, without also including numbers for \"a conservative\" and \"a liberal\" simply doesn't provide a useful context in which to interpret the numbers for \"a socialist\".\n\nI also think that, due to the way the question is asked, the poll winds up *seriously* underestimating the impact of *strategic voting* (i.e. voting for the candidate with the best chance of beating your least preferred candidate) against the GOP - I think it's just plain ludicrous to suggest that 41% of Democrats would prefer Jeb Bush to Bernie Sanders, simply because of the socialist label, but maybe I'm wrong on that point?\n\n-----\n\nAnother argument is that the GOP media machine will be able to use the socialist label to get their base frothing at the mouth and drive turnout (this relates to the 3rd example thought experiment).\n\nMy feeling here is that, considering that has been Fox news' sole purpose for the last 8 years, they are already well beyond the point of diminishing returns - there is no part of the base, who is amenable to this sort of strategy, who isn't *already* frothing at the mouth, socialist or no - trying to use the socialist label to wring *even more* turnout from their base, at this point, is trying to squeeze blood from a stone.\n\n-----\n\nFinally, while the GOP's fear/anger-based strategy for motivating turnout is a finely-tuned machine at this point, turnout among Democrats is much more variable - so many on the left feel entirely apathetic towards the party, so turnout is unreliable.\n\nI will admit, I don't even know exactly why, but Hillary seems to *personify* what people on the left are apathetic towards - nobody, *nobody* I've talked to, on Reddit or IRL, seems excited about Hillary. On the other hand, among those who have become familiar with Bernie as a candidate, he seems to energize people in a way that I've simply seen no recent evidence of *any* other potential candidate even coming close to.\n\nSince voter-apathy seems to be a fairly huge problem on the left (relative to the right, at least) this seems like a *huge* point in Bernie's favor - especially because it could also have a fairly significant impact on Congressional races.\n\n-----\n\nOne last thing: I know the socialist label is a big part of this discussion, but I don't want it to devolve into an **exclusive** focus on that - I am interested in how Bernie stacks up *against Hillary*, so if you are going to talk about how people respond to the socialist label, please keep it in the context of a comparison with how people respond to Hillary as a political fixture."}

Here are the common arguments I've heard for martian colonization:\n\n1. **We will run out of resources on earth.**  Mars could be made of diamonds, iPhone 7's, and Amazon gift cards and it still wouldn't be worth the cost to go there.  Furthermore it is a huge use of our limited resources here on earth to create and continue to supply a settlement on mars.\n2. **We could get hit by an asteriod or nuke ourselves.**  True, but aren't there much cheaper ways to invest in the continuation of mankind?  We could build bunkers near the center of the earth, we could create satelites to detect, shift or destroy meteors or other space debris that threatens us, and that would save all of mankind, not just the limited amount who might have gone to mars.\n3. **Exploration/mapping the universe.** Don't satelites do this better and much more cheaply?\n4. **Inspiration for potential scientists.**  This one seems true, but there are many other things that kids dream of just as much.  When I was a kid I was inspired to become a programmer by watching giant fighting robots who could transform into cars.  That doesn't seem like a good enough reason to invest in building real life transformers with government money.\n5. **Potential innovations as byproducts.**  I know there are a lot of examples of this from the trip to the moon, but couldn't we have focused directly on getting benefits we know we want?  For example, life extension.  We are beginning to see that it may be possible to obtain immortality or close to it.  The direct result of this would cause immeasureable progress to humanity.  Our greatest minds could live forever.  Our scientists and innovators could live longer and produce even greater inventions.  Why not focus on that instead?\n\nEdit: I'm really willing to change my view, many people way smarter than me advocate for martian colonization, I am really trying to understand what is the reason for it, what's with all the downvotes?"}
{"title": "CMV: Not Everyone Is Beautiful. Self-esteem Efforts Are Misguided.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3e33lg", "selftext": "I've seen quite a bit in recent years on social media, TV, and other mediums, an attempt to bring up the self-esteem of many people, most notably of which is probably young women.  The idea is fantastic, but the methodology is misguided.\n\nThe problem we have faced in the past is a woman's worth being tied directly to her physical attractiveness.  If a woman was physically beautiful, she was desirable, regardless of intelligence, personality, work ethic, values, etc.  Of course, I'm over simplifying just a bit, but we're all aware of the problem.\n\nFast forward to recent years, and we have lots of groups attempting to combat the problem of physical attractiveness being a woman's value, but this is off base.  They attempt to solve the problem by redefining beauty.  They try to convince young ladies that everyone is beautiful, that curves (fat) are beautiful, that acne is beautiful, that being flat-chested is beautiful, etc.  Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but when you were to approach it from a statistical view, it is obvious that certain traits are generally more desirable than others.  This is why most professional models are tall, have small waists, have angular facial features, small noses, full lips, large breasts, long arms, long fingers, long legs proportionally.\n\nWhat is largely ignored by social campaigns that, in some ways, demonize beauty, is the idea of acceptance.  Girls and guys are not taught to accept that they were dealt a certain set of cards for life.  You can take care of your body, work out, eat healthy, etc, to get the most out of what you've been given, but young people are not generally taught to accept that they are who they are and they have certain limitations to live within.  If you're short, frumpy, have a big nose, acne, or whatever, I believe it's better to teach people to accept who you are.  It reminds me of a line from \"The Incredibles\" that made perfect sense.  Yes, I'm referencing a child's movie, but that doesn't mean it isn't valid.  The main bad guy is Syndrome, and part of his sinister plot is to give everyone super powers because, \"When everyone is super, no one will be.\"\n\nMuch in the same way, if everyone is beautiful, then nobody is beautiful.\n\nFor guys, a possible equivalent to a female's beauty is a man's athleticism.  However, it doesn't seem that guy's are taught to be fooled into thinking everyone is athletic.  Because beauty is more subjective, it is more difficult to quantify, but with athleticism, no one would try to tell me I'm just as athletic as Anthony Davis to make me feel better.  They'd tell me he's a special athlete, and I need to accept I'll never be a professional athlete, and I need to not tie my worth to my athleticism. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We don't consider those attacks terrorist attacks, we consider them strikes on legitimate military targets that weaken our enemy.

Whether they are doing it to decrease chances of accidents or they are revenue raising, the power still lies completely in the hand of the person behind the wheel.\n\nEven if the police had the intention of revenue raising, that money still goes toward hiring more officers, putting more police cars on the road and getting better technology to combat road accidents. They aren't making anyone speed, they are just making the best of the fact that people are going to speed, so they might as well bring some revenue in from it.\n\nEdit: I should have clarified that I am referring exclusively to traffic offences eg. Speeding, drink driving etc.\n\nEdit: My view has been changed.\n\nI now see that the motivations behind revenue raising contradict the motivations that the police service is created to have. If revenue raising was the goal, the Police service would not only be out for the wrong reasons, but the entire outcome of what they would achieve would be counterproductive to society as a whole.

The whole USA is going through an embarrassing struggle with healthcare. Parts of the country such as San Francisco are having crises with housing availability and sky-rocketing rent. The cost of college has increased staggeringly in our lifetime.

Disgust. Anger. Resentment. Spitefulness. \n\nMost humans would associate these responses alongside mass displays of torture or killing. Perhaps such a countenance would be most appropriately donned whilst becoming informed of the latest school shooting. There are many permissible circumstances in which one would be justified to feel such repulsion. \n\nThis is what I feel when discussing women's issues. \n\nThroughout my young adult life, I have always sought out knowledge which furthered the distance between my personal beliefs and my upbringing. As a son of a son of a sharecropper from southern Mississippi, I was raised with fundamentalist Christian, neo-conservative paradigms.\nYet, for some reason, while the aforementioned constructs were so easily eliminated from my reality... Even the flurry of knowledge and humanity which spurned such personal renaissance was futile in this regard as I have trouble even acknowledging the women's rights movements as anything more meaningful than tabloid journalism. \n\nIf I were to be 100% honest, I can honestly say that I've never seen racism in the corporate world. Yet sexism does abound. I work in Network Security, one of the most male-dominated fields known to exist within corporate boundaries. Many women have spoken out about this, but I can confirm it is similar in experience to the way [this blogger has put it] (http://www.themakersofthings.com/2010/03/melissa-hathaway-internet-security.html). \nI have worked under superiors who have outright stated their unwillingness to employ females, especially on male-dominated teams. I have seen a group of men conspire against a female counterpart in pursuit of righting perceived wrongs. \n\nIn my few short attempts to annihilate this final bastion of uneducated ignorance, (which, admittedly, has been expressed and interpreted as sexism) I have failed miserably. When the fallacies which seem to form the battle-cry for many associated with feminist movements ([70% Statistic](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christina-hoff-sommers/wage-gap_b_2073804.html) and the [biological implications of gender] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjernevask)) are seemingly ignored, it is very hard to empathize.\n\nBut today I received the inspiration behind this urgent desire for comprehension: \n\nI was offered the position of a lifetime on the basis that the only other candidate in serious consideration, a female, wouldn't be quite capable of dealing with the \"stresses of the environment\". That was the official response I was given by my new supervisor... But while I've only been with the company for 6 months, she has been in her position for 4 years. Same department. No movement. \n\nThe guys make fun of her constantly. She makes it easy.\nWe use a chatroom/voting app online to determine where we go to lunch everyday. I was invited to it the first day of my employment, when I was treated to lunch. She discovered it about a month ago, when I spilled the beans by accident. \nWhen the guys at lunch found out, they told me she would \"ruin the fun\" and joked that there \"isn't a way to value an account as .7 a vote\". \n\nI laughed at the jokes and agreed with the remarks. This is my comfort zone. \n\nBut when she handed in her resignation this morning upon hearing the decision, I couldn't help but feel a little bit guilty. \n\nFor her coworkers, who viewed her as an unforgiving political stalwart, it was a victory. For her boss, who she had reported to HR twice for sexual harassment/discrimination, it was a monumental occasion. \n\n\"(He) had been trying to figure out how to fire her since (he) had been hired.\" he expounded at lunch today. \n\nBut when I stopped by her office this morning and saw the trash bin full of Kleenex alongside the two workplace 'awards' she had been given... it was difficult. Her eyes spelled defeat... deep. Not the kind that you come back from. The kind that comes from a life of perceived failure.  \n\nThe group voted to go to a wings bar and drink in celebration. I was toasted as the \"man who killed the witch.\" I smiled, but for the first time in my life I am feeling as though I must begin to confront my denial and willful ignorance. \n\nThus, I am here. Not completely by my own conscious will, but instead driven by a subconscious desire and need for justice. While I can't make things right at work, I am in a position now of senior executive leadership, the youngest to don such a title in the history of the firm. I sit at the head of a department of one of the largest financial firms in the country. I can start making a difference.\n\nThe problem I have is that I don't believe you. Even with the abhorrent anecdotal experiences I could cite, I haven't seen a shred of empirical evidence which shows this is anything outside of a few small circles. In fact, I can easily rationalize away my experiences with only a slight bit of denial.\n\nBut that would be easy. I already won a position I shouldn't have had the easy way. While I *despise* winning that way, business is business and the world keeps spinning. What I don't wish to do, however, is conduct myself in a manner in which I disadvantage my female counterparts, be they potential employees or individuals I encounter throughout my career. But I fear that my personal beliefs have a large potential for negating those altruistic ideals. \n\nWhen Ellen Pao resigned from the firm, it was apparent to everyone with connections inside the industry that she was scapegoated. It was so well-known that publishers have been forced [to address this directly.] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/07/13/who-fired-reddits-victoria-taylor-yishan-wong-alexis-ohanian-ellen-pao/)\n\nI fit the median demographic for Reddit dead-center. I despised Pao. I degrade feminists. I am sexist, but consider myself left-leaning.\n\nI am ready to change that. But everywhere I look, on every feminist site, I only see whining and complaining. No studies. No empirical evidence. Just feel-good baby food seemingly written for an emotional, illogical audience. This is how I view women's rights activists. \n\nHelp me change.

He was the product of generations of eugenics to create the perfect fighter.  He was his people's greatest military commander.  \n\nSuperman was physically stronger than the average person of his race for having grown up in the \"nutrient-rich environment\" of Earth.  But he grew up on a farm and received no formal training.  He had only barely started to have a mastery of his abilities by the time Zod and his followers arrived.  \n\nZod and his people were initially shocked by their newfound strength on Earth, but they quickly adapted.  He achieved a similar power level to Superman in a matter of days, in addition to his previous training and skills.  The advantage in sheer strength of Superman should not have been enough to overpower Zod.  It is basically like putting a Navy Seal against a body-builder.

It's insanely expensive, and to be able to afford anything nice you have to work your ass off here, much moreso than you would in the Midwest, South or even most of the Northeast.\n\nPeople are overworked and grumpy because of the whacked-out ratio between wages and cost of living. In real terms, the West is poorer than most of the Deep South. It's totally normal to work 70-90 hours a week here to make ends meet. The standard of living in material terms is considerably lower than the rest of the country and people generally have less here.\n\nThe amenities are also not as good as the rest of the country for your money. Buying a house costs twice what it does in the South and three times as much as the Midwest, and you get smaller homes and tiny yards. Many houses are poorly built and air conditioning is still a luxury not everyone here has. Which sucks when it's 100 degrees outside. \n\nThe transit sucks outside of San Francisco, inner Portland and parts of LA, and even there it's only mediocre. The water quality sucks aside from in the Pacific Northwest. People go to bed early out West and the nightlife is very boring. You BETTER like the outdoors and camping, because honestly there is almost nothing else to do here.\n\nThe schools are absolutely atrocious out West unless you live in a rich area since nobody here wants to pay their taxes. This goes from the elementary schools all the way up to the crappy community colleges (though I will give my state Oregon credit for just recently deciding to make their community colleges free, since they aren't worth paying money to attend).\n\nAside from Spanish missions there is no history here much more than 150 years old, and most of the architecture in Western US cities is tacky stuff from the 70s, 80s and 90s. No rural charm like you'd find in New England or the Midwest in the small towns.\n\nPeople aren't nearly as liberal as people believe either. It's definitely more libertarian and conservative overall. California voted against gay marriage at least once, and has passed on several opportunities to end the death penalty. The politics are very anti-worker and the trend is always to stick up for big business and the free market no matter what it costs the poor. \n\nTons of racism too, it seems like everyone in California hates the Mexican immigrants. Actually all of the races on the West Coast seem to have \"beef\" with each other, I know my Mexican ex-roommate from east LA hated black people. It's definitely not a post-racial utopia by any means. The Aryan Nations is based in Idaho after all - not the South.\n\nWest Coast people tend to be unfriendly compared to people from other regions. People don't do the neighbor thing, and meeting and talking to strangers is taboo. Whenever I travel on a Greyhound or train, it's almost always people from outside the Western US that are interested in chatting. Nobody here seems to have much of a sense of humor either and there is a tendency for West Coast people to take things way too seriously and get offended easily.\n\nIt's very easy to fall out of touch with friends here, I find, even if you thought you were super close to them. It's just a very self-oriented culture.\n\nLastly most of the Western US is not particularly pretty. While parts of it like Glacier and Yosemite are incredible, most of it is barren, flat and covered in sagebrush and short stubby grasses. Taken as a whole, the eastern US is much more green and scenic, even if it doesn't have the pockets of majesty the West has.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I think Donald Trump would make a good president", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dy30e", "selftext": "Two weeks ago, I thought Donald Trump had the biggest joke of a campaign. I didn't think anyone could take him seriously. I assumed if there were people at his campaign speeches it is because they were paid to be there. I was solidly behind Bernie Sanders. \n\nNow I am not so sure. To be clear, I still think the most important issues are the ones Bernie Sanders talks about but I think Donald Trump will be better at solving these issues. \n\nHere are the issues that I think are important to this country: \n\n1. Growing rift between the rich and the poor and the weakening middle class\n\n2. Political corruption - politicians make decisions based on who pays for their campaign rather than for the good of the voters\n\n3. National security threats like ISIS\n\n4. Imprisonment of victimless crimes like possession of marijuana\n\n5. The trillion dollar national debt\n\nI used to think gay rights and healthcare were big concerns but I think President Obama has done a good job of solving these. \n\n1. Of these five issues, I think the weakening middle class is the biggest issue and this is where I think Donald Trump beats Bernie Sanders. I think the middle class has been shrinking not because people aren't working but because there aren't high paying jobs. Yes, part of this is because the CEO's of these companies are making 300x what the lowest paid employee makes and this is where I see Bernie Sanders being effective. However, I think the much greater issue is the fact that a lot of our high paying jobs have went overseas because of bad trade deals. For example, Donald Trump mentioned Ford building a 2 billion dollar manufacturing plant in Mexico right now. If we had higher taxes on imported cars then Ford would be forced to build that factory here. Everyone knows most of our manufacturing happens overseas and this needs to happen here. When manufacturing happened in the U.S. that is when the middle class was strongest. I remember one TIL saying that the average salary for a household in today's wages in the 1950s was $55,000. And that was with one individual in the household working, whereas today normally both people have to work. I think Donald Trump would be an incredible negotiator and make deals for the United States that help bring back high paying jobs. \n\n2. Political corruption - Bernie Sander's record is flawless and I think because of Donald Trump's great wealth, no one could pay him off. Also, while most politicians make money from the increased attention they receive from campaigning, Donald Trump has already lost money from his campaign due to sponsorship deals like Macy's falling through and NBC's Miss America Pageant being canceled. \n\n3. National Security - I have not heard an effective strategy for dealing with ISIS until I heard something Donald Trump said. He wants to deprive them of their wealth. ISIS is making a killing from selling oil. Donald Trump said he would bomb the oil fields then make a protective ring around the oil and have companies rebuild the oil fields. Now, this is pretty aggressive behavior. Not too much different than what Putin did with Crimea. However, it's a great deal for the American people. We get cheap oil, we are not nation building, and ISIS gets drained of money and can't buy weapons, can't pay soldiers, and can't continue their operations. I hate seeing these wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from a selfish perspective because they cost trillions of dollars. We send billions of dollars removing a horrific dictator, yet we get no thanks. Many Iraqis hate us and they are not paying back any of the money it cost us to help them. I think Donald Trump will make us more secure and could save us billions on national security. \n\n4. Imprisonment of victimless crimes - without a doubt Bernie Sanders would be better at this. I don't see Donald Trump removing harsh sentences anytime soon. \n\n5. The national debt - Yes, a lot of this is owed to American citizens and the government gets a deal because interest payments are less than inflation. Still, I think it is a problem. Bernie Sanders would solve this issue by raising taxes on the wealthy which would be effective. Donald Trump would do this by bringing more taxable money into the country via better trade deals. \n\nFinally, one last issue I see with Bernie Sanders is that even though I think higher taxes will solve a lot of problems, I still don't trust the government with its money management. I think Donald Trump would bring much more money back into the country from better trade deals. I don't like Trump's position on Edward Snowden (called him a traitor). I don't think creating more government jobs like Greece did is a solution but it is something I think Bernie Sanders will do. \n\nI think Barack Obama has done a great job so far. Unemployment is down and healthcare coverage is up. Unfortunately we still have troops all over the world and Russia is growing in size despite economic sanctions. Our Iran deal wasn't that great (we didn't get our hostages back and we had to give Israel free weapons to placate them) and NSA spying seems to have continued although I am not sure after that recent court ruling. Civil rights have improved. \n\nI know I have mentioned a lot of different issues. The most important one to me is the shrinking wealth of the middle class. I believe the healthiest societies are one where there is small difference between rich and poor. In summary, I think Bernie Sanders treats the symptoms of the problem rather than the root. I think Donald Trump solves the root of the problem by bringing more jobs back to this country. \n\nI will also mention this because I know it will be brought up - Donald Trump has went into bankruptcy four times. To my understanding, he declared bankruptcy on certain assets and then retained those assets at the lower valuation. I don't know the in's and out's. \n\nFinally, Donald Trump has a big ego and says idiotic things like 'most of the mexicans crossing the border are rapists.' I know illegal immigrants are a vital part to our country's economy and I didn't like that he said this. However I think what needs to be reformed are laws so that people who want to work can get in more easily. That doesn't mean they should just be able to walk in. I don't care if they do, but I think from a national security standpoint, we should be able to regulate what comes into our borders. Obama has done a great job at making it easier for illegals to get documentation. That said, there are problems that are caused by an unsecured border. The drug traffic is terrible for both the US even worse for Mexico. A secured border would fix this.\n\nI know this has been a lot to read. I take my voting decision very seriously and I want to have good information. Thank you.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: The term \"white trash\" is racist to every race but whites", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dxn2g", "selftext": "Warning you now, I use some hefty racial slurs in my explanation. I'm not racist and don't support the use of any of these terms, but I'm going to use them here as examples. \n\nNow I'm not one for overly \"SJW\"-like thinking, and I'm not personally outraged by the term, but I'm floored by how rarely I see anyone realize or even acknowledge that the term is racist. The phrasing \"white trash\" assumes that white people are inherently not trash and that this is a special exemption to the rule and needs to be labeled as such. One doesn't say \"black nigger\" or \"mexican spic\", the hate is built into the word itself. The word *is* the hate label. Having to specify \"white\" before your insult just makes it seem like it's shocking to you that a white person is behaving abnormally. Like they're a weird example of a white person instead of just another white person in a sea of different examples.\n\nNow, I've heard the arguments before that \"there's no good word to throw at white people\" and \"I use the term and I'm not racist\". Neither of these are valid points. A lack of a \"good\" insult doesn't make a bad one \"good\" and your feelings on the matter have no bearing on the reality of how the term is constructed.\n\nI'm not saying people who use the term are racists, I just think they don't realize the implication. Every time I bring this up though I'm downvoted without explanation. The score will drop but I'll hear no hint of rebuttal, which has convinced me I'm right but I'm just saying something they don't like. But hey idk, maybe I'm totally wrong. I'm willing to hear it. CMV?\n\n.\n\n\n**Edit**: Wow there's a lot more here than I anticipated, sorry if I don't respond to everyone! ^^^(even ^^though ^^any ^^time ^^I ^^say ^^anything ^^it's ^^like ^^it's ^^on ^^fire ^^and ^^downvotes ^^are ^^water.)\n\nI have probably done a poor job of accurately representing my stance on the issue. In an effort to drive home my logic, I was a little extreme with my phrasing. I will concede that the use of the term isn't insulting to other races, but I think it does hint at the \"white people are normally higher class\" sentiment that fuels the entire phrase. If you find that *INSULTING/TRIGGERING* or not probably has more to due with you than the phrase but as /u/ratherenjoysbass said in the comments: \n\n\"I think white trash is fucked up in that it inherently assumes that most white people are successful, well-mannered people so we must delineate the people that did not make it as well, for some reason couldn't afford enough class, or are the genetic unwanted when compared to the rest of the white race. Most other racial slurs inherently include the entire race so even a white person saying white trash is still acknowledging racial superiority against the others.\"\n\n**Edit 2:** /u/beneaththewaves7 knocks it out of the park [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3dxn2g/cmv_the_term_white_trash_is_racist_to_every_race/ct9ws2o?context=10000) He makes my point better than me.\n\nAlso thanks to /u/tit_wrangler for the the only comment so far that I've delta'd, in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3dxn2g/cmv_the_term_white_trash_is_racist_to_every_race/ct9p2ip)\n\n"}

{"title": "CMV: Keynesian economics is a thin cover for class warfare", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dvguq", "selftext": "This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession.\n\nMy understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.\n\nOnce recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.\n\nFrom that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what\u2019s absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.\n\nAt this point, I see five possibilities:\n\n1.\tKeynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. \n2.\tKeynesian economics is *co-opted* by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. It\u2019s perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. *How* we spend and tax isn\u2019t the issue, just that we do.\n3.\tI have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to \u201cshake up the system\u201d and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more?\n4.\tI have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. \n5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty.\n\nRight now my view is hovering between One and Two, but I\u2019d really like to understand this theory better.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I would like to make the argument that Gender Identity and Gender Roles are one in the same and socially constructed. Many people argue that there are three ways to look at gender.\n\n1. Sex- This is based on physical attributes and is usually binary. This is simply the physical attributes of male, female, and intergender. These are obviously not social constructs.\n\n2. Gender Identity- This is often seen what gender people \"feel\" that they are. For example, a physical male may identify as a female, and therefore their Gender Identity is female.\n\n3. Gender Role- These are simply the societal expectations for each gender to act (i.e. Men don't wear high heels, women are more sensitive and emotional, blah blah blah)\n\nI argue that Gender Identity CAN NOT exist without Gender Roles, and identity is simply based off of perceived Gender Roles... therefore, they are also social constructs. What it means to be a women is not something that we are born with. We are taught what it means to be a man and we are taught what it means to be a women.

Death is a necessary part of evolution and the natural life cycle.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dv5pl", "selftext": "My girlfriend and I recently watched the documentary *The Immortalists* on netflix.  The documentary is about scientific efforts to help humans reverse or even eliminate the aging process.  One of the more promising avenues for doing this is through Telomerase Gene Therapy, which essentially helps to reverse natural degradation that occurs as our cells replicate (which contributes to the aging process).  Although this sounds like science fiction and we haven't actually made anything immortal, scientists have [already used telomerase gene therapy to extend the lives of mice by up to 24%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494070/).  In the documentary (and articles I've read), the people who are conducting this and other immortality research are convinced they are doing the right thing.  They believe they are working towards the betterment of mankind.\n\nGetting old sucks, no question, and death is not a pleasant thing to deal with.  But if nobody died of old age, our overpopulation concerns would be even more harrowing than they already are.  New generations wouldn't replace old generations, they would just add to them.  Human society would change even more slowly than it already does, if at all (I mean just imagine how many people from the 18th century would still be alive, and what effect that might have on our current society).  People need to be able to die, as terrible as death and aging can be.\n\nEdit: I agree that if humanity has access to interstellar travel and the resources that might bring, then the negative effects of a population explosion would be mitigated.  But if immortality became possible before interstellar colonization did, it still might be disastrous.\n\nEdit 2: Changed the wording.\n\nEdit 3: My view has been successfully changed.

In fact, pretty much anything you attack by generalising a group based on one bad example -- I feel the need to not only unfollow you, I think I need to make sure you understand why I'm doing it. Publicly.\n\nThat goes equally for people that make unfair assertions about people it's \"cool\" to hate: Such as calling UKIP (UK Independence Party who exist to try and remove the UK from the EU) racists, or Conservatives (once again, a UK political party, currently in Government office) thieves, or the police thugs. I've never met a racist UKIP member, a Conservative thief, or a police thug.\n\nPrejudice happens. We all have prejudices. I have prejudices. Allowing that prejudice to become discrimination, and that discrimination becoming openly attacking people is something we all need to combat.

They DO know better and choose to be inflammatory.\n\nGeneralising a group of people based on bad information is exactly why many major conflicts occur worldwide. I'm not talking about in history and making a veiled Nazi reference, I'm talking about today. People *today* are excluded because of sweeping generalisations like the ones these people perpetuate.\n\nI can't stand silently by it any longer.

{"title": "CMV: The UK fox-hunting ban, as it currently stands, is inconsistent and nonsensical.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dr44t", "selftext": "*Disclaimer: I'm unsure what the conventions are for this, but I decided not to go source-hunting for the various statements I'm about to make, with the understanding that if anyone disputes them, they should be able to find sources to the contrary (this being CMV, after all). If this isn't the case, let me know.*\n\nA bit of background for anyone who doesn't know: a few years ago, the UK parliament issued a ban on fox-hunting with dogs. That is to say, you can now no longer deliberately set dogs to chase a fox, and subsequently allow them to kill it.\n\nMy contention is that the sole reason for this legislation is to 'spite' the upper-class practitioners of the 'sport' of fox-hunting (which I am not a part of, to be clear), which usually takes place in the form of a grand hunt with hordes of dogs, horses, horn blowing etc.\n\nMy reason for this is quite simple: though ostensibly designed to prevent animal cruelty, foxes are still classed as vermin in the UK. This means that you can legally kill them in the wild, without any reason, by pretty much any means you like. This includes snaring, a common method employed by farms, whereupon a trap is laid to catch the fox's leg in a loop of wire, restricting its movement and causing it to starve to death over a period of several days. Other traps and poisons can also be used, and I can say from experience in a rural environment that regulations are non-existent in practise.\n\nThe argument made by proponents is that, for the fox, being hunted in the manner I described is truly terrifying, and the dogs proceed to brutally rip them to pieces. They tend to use a lot of emotional language about how horrific it is, and make unsubstantiated claims about how these evil fox-hunters paint blood on their children's faces. The best thing is, I don't even need to argue against any of these, because *the ban doesn't even target them*.\n\nWhile the foxes can no longer be *killed* by the dogs, the hunting itself is still very much legal. Now, the hunters simply finish it off with a gun, or a bird of prey. If they were feeling sadistic, they could even starve it to death over a period of several days, laughing and stroking their *evil* moustaches as it gets progressively weaker and pained. The ban doesn't even do the job they supposedly designed it for, and yet people still defend it.\n\nI would go one further, and argue that even an 'improved' ban that targets fox-hunting more effectively isn't a good idea. The other common argument I hear is that fox-hunting is, by definition, a blood sport, and that as sentient beings, we should have higher moral standards, and not indulge in the killing of animals simply for our own enjoyment.\n\nNow, I totally understand, and personally agree with, this argument. But, foxes and other animals *are still classed as vermin*; they can be killed for *any* reason, or no reason at all. Aside from much broader and stricter animal rights laws (which I would potentially be open to, but this isn't the discussion being had), the alternative (and what people seem to be in favor of) is some sort of ban on the killing of foxes for the purposes of having fun. I'm against that type of legislation on principle; laws should be based on actions, not on whether the perpetrator enjoyed themselves or not.\n\nSo, in summary, the ban as it currently stands is ineffective, inconsistent, and in my view, representative of class warfare and government-imposed moralistic regulations. This puts me in some, uh.. \"interesting\" company, politically, despite my otherwise bleeding-heart-liberal views. So please, reddit, CMV.\n\nEDIT: As /u/grogipher points out, the legislation in question only applies to England and Wales, not the whole of the UK. Apologies for any confusion caused.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: Strong belief in the existence of alien life (intelligent or otherwise) is currently unscientific", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dqi0b", "selftext": "This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don\u2019t think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you\u2019re crazy. I understand where this view comes from; the [Universe is so unimaginably huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17jymDn0W6U) and so filled with [galaxies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAVjF_7ensg), and therefore stars, and therefore [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanets_discovered_using_the_Kepler_spacecraft), there simply *must* be other life out there. My view is that this approach is fundamentally unscientific and should not be held because it is based on probability and not actual scientific evidence.\n\nMy background: I am a physics and astronomy teacher, and I teach about this subject in depth every year. I think about it and research it often. I\u2019m well acquainted with the [Drake Equation](https://xkcd.com/384/), the [Fermi Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc) and [its many possible solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI), the [Great Filter](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html), and the debate over alien life in general.\n\nMy own belief in the matter used to be strongly on the \u2018of course aliens exist out there\u2019 side, but I thought the distances were just too vast for us to ever observe them. However, my opinion was strongly shifted by the book *Alone in the Universe* by [John Gribbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gribbin), and I now think that the great profusion of life here on Earth is so rare that we are alone in the Universe.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m completely open to the idea of aliens existing. I kind of hope they do, as long as they don\u2019t destroy us all! But until we get any kind of scientific evidence that they exist \u2014 an organized signal, clear alien-made trace elements on a planet\u2019s spectroscopy, anything measurable \u2014 I think the correct scientific approach is that they don\u2019t exist. CMV.\n\nEdit 1: Some good thoughts in here, thanks. Also, some incorrect assumptions about what I'm saying. Probability is of course a useful scientific tool, the key to our understanding of quantum mechanics. But guesses about the Drake Equation boil down to probability based on no data, quite different from the data-based probability of QM.\n\nThe most compelling argument that I've read below is that because we know life happened once in the Universe with us, it could happen again. Physical laws of symmetry point to the idea that there are no unique events in the Universe. I'm not sure I agree with that, but it's given me something to think about. And so the crux of the argument comes down to abiogenesis, life from non-life. Is it easy or hard? Could it have happened only once? *Alone in the Universe* argues that a LOT of things had to go just right for us to exist. I call these things 'Drake's Denominator' in class -- the scores of things that went just right for us that might kill the huge totals of galaxies, stars, and planets.\n\nEdit 2: Delta awarded, thanks all for your thoughts. I realized that even the single data point we have about life, life here on Earth, makes it possible for other life to exist out there. We don't have any evidence yet, but it's not unscientific to imagine that it exists. I still think life is exceedingly rare out there, and perhaps we're alone. The strange thing is that we'll probably never know. The story about [Vlad the Astrophysicist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPl10L40pBM) is closer to my main view about aliens in general -- civilizations pop in and out of existence in no time at all, never having the chance to reach out across space and communicate.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is, of course, infuriating, illegal on many areas of the highway, holds up traffic, and increases the threat of road rage from the drivers behind them. Let's call these guys Left-Hand Cruisers (LHC's).\n\nWhen able to pass the LHC, I generally pass on the right, match their speed, merge in front of them, and then let off the gas. I begin slowing down, forcing them to slow or merge right in response. If they refuse to move over, I flash my hazards to get their attention and let them know I'm not going to speed back up for them (or trick them into thinking I'm having issues, whichever.)\n\nThis usually just results in the LHC realizing what they're doing, merging right, and leaving it at that. Sometimes they try to merge back into the left lane once I speed back up, but I just put the brakes on them again. The hope is that LHC's will realize that someone driving slowly in the left hand lane is a nuisance, and holds up traffic. At least they're likely to think about it, and this makes them less likely to cruise in that lane in the future.\n\nEven if they don't learn a lesson, and even if they refuse to merge right, this step will allow the faster drivers that were held up before to merge right (into the now faster lane) and pass the LHC with ease.\n\nThe only real risk is of road rage from the LHC, and I have encountered this. The normal response from them is to swing into the right hand lane, pass and merge in front of me, pedal to the metal. As long as I don't try to race them or anything, it's just left at that. They end up moving more quickly in the left-hand lane, or at least fast enough that I can't pass them again, and I leave them alone afterwards.\n\nWhen I first started doing this, I noticed a significant change in the number of LHC's (after a few weeks), and it went from 2-3 each day to maybe one every week. I felt like I was making a large impact. With the warm weather returning, their numbers are increasing, so I feel that my \"impact\" may have been largely selection bias. However, I feel that it does make some difference, whether in the short run or the long run, and is worth doing. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

When they do bring their POV into it, it's not met with shrieking hysteria like people pretend, but usually someone with a pretty strong counter-argument. I think the hard truth that people don't want to swallow is that most of the conservative and libertarian movement is pretty intellectually dishonest and disagreeable these days, and the positions are so easily refuted when they're brought out of their bubbles that it creates bitterness and an attitude of taking your ball and going home.

{"title": "CMV: If straight and cis people attend a Pride parade, they should spend some of their time there volunteering.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dmorm", "selftext": "Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.\n\nI personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a \"Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!\"\n\nAnd, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are \"showing\" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.\n\nThis is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.\n\ntl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.\n\n**EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV:We'd be better off if Napoleon had won at Waterloo.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dk4k6", "selftext": "I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/we-better-off-napoleon-never-lost-waterloo-180955298/?no-ist), which is fascinating if you just fancy some historical reading. Basically, if Napoleon has won at Waterloo, and completed his conquest of Europe (bar Russia, of course, and maybe England), the continent would have flourished economically, socially and politically, more so than now. I will highlight the main points below. \n\n\n**1. Revolutionary domestic reforms which all of Europe would have continued to benefit from.**\n\n*\"Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories, but for his domestic reforms, especially the Code Napoleon, that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single, easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact, Napoleon\u2019s years as first consul, from 1799 to 1804, were extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on lyc\u00e9es and grandes \u00e9coles and the Sorbonne, which put France at the forefront of European educational achievement. He consolidated the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of State, which still vets the laws of France, and the Court of Audit, which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we still enjoy, both the useful\u2014the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it, the sewers and reservoirs\u2014and the beautiful, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Rue de Rivoli and the Vend\u00f4me column.\"*\n\nNapoleon was an extraordinary governor. Many of his reforms are what the rest of Europe based their institutions on, only much later.\n\n\n**2. Napoleon was a lover, not a fighter.**\n\n*In September 1805, Austria invaded Napoleon\u2019s ally Bavaria, and Russia declared war on France as well. Napoleon swiftly won the ensuing War of the Third Coalition with his finest victory, at Austerlitz in 1805. The next year the Prussians also declared war on him, but they were soundly defeated at Jena; Napoleon\u2019s peace treaty of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia followed. The Austrians declared war on France once more in 1809, but were dispatched at the Battle of Wagram and signed yet another peace treaty.\n\nNapoleon started none of those wars, but he won all of them. After 1809 there was an uneasy peace with the three other Continental powers, but in 1812 he responded to France\u2019s being cut out of Russian markets\u2014in violation of the Tilsit terms\u2014by invading Russia. That ended in the catastrophic retreat from Moscow, which cost him more than half a million casualties and left his Grande Arm\u00e9e too vitiated to deter Austria and Prussia from joining his enemies Russia and Britain in 1813.*\n\nBar the Russian Invasion mistake (and I will concede that it was a hell of a mistake), Napoleon did not display the characteristics of a warmonger. Upon his return from exile, his charisma as a leader ensured he reclaimed the throne without shedding a drop of blood, as each army sent to fight him joined him immediately. \n\nWhen he was condemned by the allies in the Vienna Declaration, he wrote to them - \u201cAfter presenting the spectacle of great campaigns to the world, from now on it will be more pleasant to know no other rivalry than that of the benefits of peace, of no other struggle than the holy conflict of the happiness of peoples.\u201d\n\nYou can argue that it was just posturing, but there is no precedent to suggest it was not genuine.\n\n*He told his council that he had renounced any dream of reconstituting the empire and that \u201chenceforth the happiness and the consolidation\u201d of France \u201cshall be the object of all my thoughts.\u201d He refrained from taking measures against anyone who had betrayed him the previous year. \u201cOf all that individuals have done, written or said since the taking of Paris,\u201d he proclaimed, \u201cI shall forever remain ignorant.\u201d He immediately set about instituting a new liberal constitution incorporating trial by jury, freedom of speech and a bicameral legislature that curtailed some of his own powers; it was written by the former opposition politician Benjamin Constant, whom he had once sent into internal exile.*\n\nHe immediately set about refunding the art galleries and public buildings of Paris, in the 12 weeks before the war would begin.\n\n**3. Liberalism in the rest of Europe would have thrived.**\n\n*If Napoleon had remained emperor of France for the six years remaining in his natural life, European civilization would have benefited inestimably. The reactionary Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia and Austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe and elsewhere; pressure to join France in abolishing slavery in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean would have grown; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated; Jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the Papal States and made to wear the yellow star again; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied; and the plans to rebuild Paris would have been implemented, making it the most gorgeous city in the world.*\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Napoleon was an all round great dude, and great leader who accomplished so much in such little time. If he had stayed in power for the 6 more years until his death, France and Europe would have benefitted greatly from it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Kinda like 'I'm sharing how much of myself, now everyone feels entitled to my face too?'\n\n* As someone who wants to start enjoying the posts, it limits who is going to be posting which is disappointing. \n\n* If the point was to avoid 'floating dicks' everywhere, which makes more sense than the reasoning they give, then the amount of body shown should be the requirement. \n\nI don't think anyone should have to compromise their identity or do something many would be really uncomfortable with to be allowed to post on a subreddit.

Compensating for individual biases, this still makes sense in my mind.\n\nAs a minority, I have felt the effects of social engineering firsthand. Asian achieves academically? Expected. White achieves academically? Studious, hard working, brilliant. Media headlines such as \"Asians too smart for their own good\" (Ivy league schools refuse high-scoring Asians) come with subtle implications that the Asian identity is attached to intelligence.\n\nFurthermore, look at Hollywood. Positive Asian male role models: Sung Kang? Most films in Hollywood that cast Asians cast them in one of these roles:\n\n* Nerd\n* Joker\n* Hardworking worker, but not leader\n* Involved in organized crime (is antagonist/evil-protagonist)\n\nMeanwhile, most Asian women are cast as the \"prize\" for the dominant white lead role. For example, Hugh Jackman and Tao Okamoto in \"The Wolverine.\" One could argue that Rila Fukushima was cast to demonstrate a strong, independent female role model, but that doesn't change the fact that the romantic interest was obviously forcefully written into the film like an afterthought in order to generate revenue.\n\nThis is just some of my experience as an Canadian Asian.

He then said \u201cIf it\u2019s good enough for Mohammed Ali, its good enough for me.\u201d This helped a bit though I\u2019m still not thoroughly convinced.\n\n\nI still find the idea of the repeating one of these mantras so corny and I don\u2019t think I could do it wholeheartedly with belief in it which would be needed for it to help.\n\n\nHelp me change my view.\n"}
{"title": "CMV: Marriage is an unreasonable expectation of relationships.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dj5zp", "selftext": "New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong.\n\nBefore I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal observations. Also my grammar isn't the best so please forgive any errors.\n \nThe main issue I have with marriage is the consequences of ending it. I do understand that this can be avoided to a degree with prenuptial agreements however, they are generally frowned upon. The idea of penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship seems counterproductive to me. This creates a sense of security to those who have refrained from showing or disclosing certain habits or personality traits to their spouse. It also encourages many to \"let themselves go.\" By that I mean things such as weight gain, poor hygiene, addictions, etc. \n\nSecondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.\n\nAll of that said, my opinion is probably a bit biased due to my now divorced parents' marriage, but I am open to hear other arguments on the issue.\n\nEdit: First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their responses. I'd just like to clear up some things I didn't communicate well in my post.\n\n1. By penalizing I wasn't just referring to spousal support and alimony but the legal fees as well.\n\n2. The argument I made was not meant to necessarily knock the institution of marriage because I do think it can work but there does exist many problems with how a failed marriage is dealt with...at least here in the US. My issue is mainly with society's expectation that long term relationships must eventually lead to marriage when it is not for everyone.\n\nLastly, a few of you pointed out the issues that arise when one spouse stays at home with the children and the other wants out of the marriage down the line. I do now see more of a purpose for it when the intention is to start a family. \n"}

Anyways, in the article it talks about the rise of AGI, Artificial General Intelligence, or AI that's equivalently as smart as a human (the human equivalent is fairly unimportant, a self-learning AGI would go from the dumbest human to the smartest in a fairly insignificant amount of time).  Anyways, the article then talks about the upcoming ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) in which AIs would be unfathomably smarter than us.  Imagine how much smarter we are to ants and how a lot of the things that we regularly think of ants can't even conceive in their brains.  That but worse, and the AIs are the humans and we are the ants.  Now the article talks about a lot of implications of this, but one large implication is that it could lead to species extinction, or species immortality.  The former because it could wipe out humans for our relative uselessness (maybe more useful as raw meterials) and the latter because we could either digitally store our consciousness for eternity or rejuvenate our bodies by continuing to reconstruct any bodily decay, atom by atom, quark by quark, etc.  Anyways, scientists have no idea right now what will happen, especially because the AI is so much smarter than us that we can't predict the possible outcomes of what it will do, whether killing or saving us all.  \n\nBecause of that, some scientists say that we should be as careful as possible approaching the AI so that we don't accidentally create an ASI that will destroy all humanity.  But for current humans, we're going to die anyways, so the extinction of a human race is just our eventual death that will happen regardless.  But we have one shot at living forever, one way or another, and with our own interests in mind, we should try to get there as fast as possible so that we have the highest chance of achieving our own immortality.  If we mess it up, then we die anyways, but if we achieve species immortality its the ultimate prize, as contrasted to being cautious and dying before species immortality is achieved.  And secondly, if we use the model of our own brains in making this AI, then even if it does kill us all, part of us will love on within AI.  CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I believe that anyone of any size can be *healthier* at that size. If I start jogging once a week, I probably won't lose weight, but I'll be a teeny-tiny bit healthier and that's good. \n\nSecondly, BMI is an overall population indicator. There are of course given people who are overweight who are healthier than given people who are within normal range. Same goes for given people who are underweight vs people in normal range. However, I would state that *in general*, the further you slide on the scale from 22.5 in either direction, the further you're getting from optimal.\n\nHowever, wherever people lie on that scale - underweight -&gt; optimal -&gt; fat is none of your fucking business whatsoever.\n\nYou are not a stakeholder in a stranger's health and people would do well to keep their mouths shut about other people's appearance. If you *are*  stakeholder in their health (and this is exclusively limited to loved ones and the person's healthcare practitioners) then maybe you get to say something. *Maybe*.\n\nThe best analogy for this is smoking. I smoke and am slightly overweight (~10lb) and it is certainly the smoking that is more detrimental to my health than the few extra pounds.\n\nI *know* that smoking is bad for me - I'm not an idiot. I view the HAES as a bit like \"Healthy No Matter How Much You Smoke\". It's not true, it may even be damaging. On the other hand, encouraging hardened smokers to run around despite being smokers ain't a bad thing. Attack the campaign, if you must, but leave the people alone.\n\nIt does not matter how many people tell me that smoking is bad for me. Their statements are uninvited, irritating and will do precisely nothing to change my habits. They may even reinforce them. \n\nIt is *none* of their business if I smoke.\n\nYou know when you're eating pizza and you have that one vegan health nut friend who tells you about how pepperoni is full of carcinogens and dairy will cause all kinds of damage to you? That, **at best** is what fat shamers come off like.\n\nI'm not saying there shouldn't be public health campaigns (much like we have anti-smoking campaigns), just that YOU PERSONALLY should never say a damn thing about a stranger's weight, EVER. \n\n*EDIT: Good discussion, guys.

{"title": "CMV: Women and Men (who are both heterosexual) cannot be platonic friends and are using each other, in most cases. And I find it unnecessary baggage within a relationship.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dhvig", "selftext": "I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal when I wasn't in a relationship and I would just turn them down. Once I was, they all tried much harder than usual to pursue something whereas before it was a more passive attempt. Once they realized I was \"off the table\" of sorts and was serious about my now boyfriend, the relationship just dwindled despite my continuing to talk to them just as much as before. I realized this was because the conversation would always be very short due to me not replying to flirtatious texts which probably got really boring for them. \n\nWhat I mean by men and women cannot be just friends is that one or the other (possibly both), even if not having a physical relationship, is using each other for the ego boost that comes with someone of the opposite sex giving you attention and would under other circumstances, definitely hook up (or maybe at one point in time already have).  I also noticed even women who have a lot of male friends they spent a lot of time with and \"friend zoned\" them, they would still get weird and upset if the man was in a romantic relationship and therefore had less time to expend for her because it was going to his SO. This doesn't happen with their male friends as long as they see them enough because the male friends aren't using their male friends to feel attractive.. but suddenly \"just\" female friends tend to get very territorial once they aren't getting the attention from the male friend that they were used to or able to get that constant validation. \n\nOf course there will ALWAYS be exceptions. But I think, on average, this all proves to be true. This is also why I am pretty uncomfortable with my boyfriend having female friends that aren't also people I've met and felt comfortable with. He can, of course, but it makes me feel uncomfortable. The one he introduced me to automatically displayed the classic signs of using him for attention and being very touchy but pretending it's simply a \"brother\" like relationship. I would like to be comfortable with such friendships but it seems unnecessary to me within a relationship. In a group setting is fine, of course, as long as everyone is comfortable (which doesn't seem to happen if the friend has been in the persons life longer than the SO) but I am talking about opposite sex friendships when one or both parties are in a relationship with other people...I feel they have no reason to spend a lot of time interacting or spending time together one-on-one unless they are both lying to each other (or one person is) and hoping that something will happen (sexually or otherwise) without admitting it to themselves or like the [in my opinion] inappropriate feeling of playing with fire. \n\nI hold myself to the same standard, of course. My one male friend that has not tried anything was also my roommate but I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even. We would hang out alone sometimes but in public (during daytime) or just while one or the other is in the kitchen cooking. I don't think anything would happen if we did drink alone, as we have before I was dating my boyfriend, but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway. I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me. This is ONE of those exceptions out of the plenty of male friends who out of nowhere have tried to hook up or tell me they have feelings for me and I suspect is not the average dynamic of a male-female friendship. So while I think it MAY be possible, it is somewhat rare. \n\nObviously my view also applies to those who are strictly in monogamous relationships.\n\nTl;dr: \nMost men who have female \"platonic\" friends would sleep with them if the opportunity arose and if are in a relationship, only keep them around in case and because of the ego boost of being around women who aren't unattractive (to feel wanted). Most women who have male \"platonic\" friends are using them for the attention they get by feeling a man likes them, and can't have them to feel like a sought-after, high quality woman...and also get jealous when they begin dating a woman despite their \"just friend\" claims. always exceptions, but believe this to be generally true.

{"title": "CMV: Everyone else should just let White Males have reddit", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dhde9", "selftext": "With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling \"invaded\" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. \n\nSo here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and \"dark side\" of reddit.\n\n\nEdit: reply from /r/nannyhap produced new idea that perhaps having a place that tolerates hateful views makes for an artificial influx of them.

My problem is that I cant see the point or the reason for watching, or even creating sort-of-these high-budget low-artform movies. \n\n\nOne thing I wont get is why people watching these movies, their reboots over and over past decades. I can accept that old spiderman movies from early 2000s are childhood for some people and I fully respect it.  But what is gonna give you when you make reboot (like latest spiderman honestly), which is ruining franchise? Are you aiming for lower-age audience? Are doing it JUST for money? Dont know the answer.\n\nThen, there comes a popularity of those movies. Did we came to stage that we are going to Cinema only for those \"films\" but killing the rest of the cinema originality? When you come to that stage, Hollywood biggest studios have only concern for this type of extremly profitable movies and loosing care of \"true movies\".\n\nThen, I cant stand the marketing of the movies. You can see list of next superhero movies by marvel or DC for next 10 years, whats the point of that? That you will see next 10 same bad movies only with different villain? **By my point, when you are longering the franchise for long as possible, you are fooling your fans.**\n\nThen, there is a Superhero films in nutshell: People (or heroes, avengers, what-so-ever) are doing extremly unlogical decisions, killing people like robots (no emotion in there) and just killing villains, prepairing for it or just making their way of their personal problems. This is same for most of the movies. (If I didnt saw some best superhero movie, whitch doesnt do wrong these things, reccommend me one). \n\nFor once in while, I can see a good superhero movie, like Batman trilogy from Christopher Nolan. They are doing same things (beating villains, prepairing....) but they are doing it in way to respect the franchise. And its offen rare that someone like Nolan will accept a offer for another superhero blockbuster. \n\nAm I too old, or the movies are for 12year olds (like MLP), but adults love it anyway? Can someone tell me? Besides that, please dont look at my grammar. Its extremly late and Im tired as hell.\n\nThanks, and CMV :).\n\n**Edit 1: Much thanks for really great amount of replies and CMVs, I dont know if I can answer them all as well (maybe sometime). CMV community somehow explained to me how big is lore behind \"SH movies\", or how helpful they can be for people who cant read comics. BUT, I AM NOT SATISFIED with one thing. WHY these movies are people prefering then something new and fresh, why they want to see same exact movies for next 10 years or why \"casual viewers\" dont try something new.  Thanks for each letter your write.**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: I believe that socialism is fundamentally better than capitalism", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dfjej", "selftext": "For the purpose of this post, I am defining \"capitalism\" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. \"Socialism\" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.\n\nAnd that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.\n\nNot only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). \n\nSo, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.\n\nI guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!\n\nEDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: The left's response to Bush's comments on working more hours is just like the right's reaction to Obama's \" If you\u2019ve got a business \u2014 you didn\u2019t build that\".", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dfev0", "selftext": "Reddit, I have been causally watching this Jeb Bush comment make its rounds around the internet and news sites. It seemed pretty obvious to me the first time I heard it that he was talking about trying to reduce part time jobs and have more full time jobs. I am not trying to debate the merit of his argument or if the president has any say on if this could happen or not.\n\nBush Interview:\n\n&gt; BUSH: My aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4% growth as far as the eye can see. Which means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows. It means that people need to work longer hours and, through their productivity, gain more income for their families. That's the only way we're going to get out of this rut that we're in.\n&gt; \n&gt; QUESTION: To keep us from taking it out of context, what you meant to say \u2014 when you say more hours you mean full-time work.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUSH: Given the opportunity to work. Yeah, absolutely.\n&gt; \n&gt; QUESTION: Not that a full-time guy or somebody working two jobs needs to be working even more time.\n&gt; \n&gt; BUSH: Absolutely not. Their incomes need to grow. It's not going to grow in an environment where the costs of doing business are so extraordinarily high here. Healthcare costs are rising. In many places the cost of doing business is extraordinarily high, and the net result of that is that business start up rates are at an all-time low. Work-force participation rates are low. If anyone is celebrating this anemic recovery, then they are totally out of touch. The simple fact is people are really struggling. So giving people a chance to work longer hours has got to be part of the answer. If not, you are going to see people lose hope. And that's where we are today.\n\nObama's Quote: \n\n\"If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you\u2019ve got a business \u2014 you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn\u2019t get invented on its own.

{"title": "CMV: The predictions made in The Torah, their unlikeliness and the fact that they came true, make a strong case for the truth of the Torah", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3df23x", "selftext": "Note: I do not believe that these prove anything conclusively, either the truth of the torah nor the existence of god, just that these predictions make a very strong case. \n\nDeuteronomy 28 consists, basically, of a long series of predictions for the fate of the jews. Among these are that the temple will be destroyed, the jews will be scattered across the globe, they will be persecuted and remain small in number,  and that they will eventually return to the land of israel. \n\nIm currently on mobile with a very poor connection and can not find all of the relevant quotes but here are some:\n\n\"The Lord will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies, a nation whose language you will not understand, a nation of fierce countenance, which does not respect the elderly nor show favour to the young.\"\n\nWhen the jews were conquered and the temple was destroyed, it was done so by the romans who spoke latin. The jews at this time would not have understood latin.  However, had nearly any other large or close nation been the ones to attack the jews, it is very likely that they would have known the language. Many of the closer nations, the jews traded with or dealt with politically and thus would have known their language.  Because of this, predicting that their conquerors would speak an unknown language is not a likely prediction and it is strange that it comes true. \n\n\"AND THE L-RD SHALL SCATTER THEE AMONG ALL PEOPLE, FROM THE ONE END OF THE EARTH EVEN UNTO THE OTHER; AND THERETHOU SHALT SERVE OTHER G-DS,\"\n\nWhen the jews were conquered, they were scattered across the lands. This is strange both as a prediction and as an event. After conquering a nation, it was rare, if it happened at all, for the nation to be dispersed in this manner. Usually the conquerors would either use their victims as slaves, or keep them around to collect taxes. To disperse a nation like this makes no sense because then the conquerors have much less to gain. \n\n\"You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God.\"\n\nThe prediction here is that the jewish population will remain small. This has also come true. The current jewish population is around 14.2 millions people, or only .2% of the world. While few in number is not specific, remaining less than a percent of the world seems to be fairly small. \n\n\"Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the Lord will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. 66 You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.\"\n\nThis verse seems to indicate the ever presence of anti-semitism.  Despite being so small in numbers, jews have faced persecution at nearly every place they have gone. This prediction seems more obvious, as many strangers seem to face discrimination, but a prediction that came true regardless. \n\nEdit:  I don't have any more time to post tonight, but I will be able to read anything posted tomorrow. I awarded one delta for proof that the jews would have very likely spoken latin at that time. Any further direct contradictions to any of the prophecies, as well as any other prophecies in this section of the torah that don't come true would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, examples of predictions from other major religions that came true in similar matters would help. Thanks CMV!\n\n\"The Lord your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you and he will gather you in from all the nations to He had scattered you. Even if you will be dispersed to the end of the Heavens \u2013 from there your God will gather you\u2026God will gather you and bring you back to the land that your forefathers possessed and you shall posses it.\u201d\n\nThis is actually from chapter 30, but is still relevant. To have predicted 3000 years ago that the jews would not only be kicked out of israel, but would eventually come back to own it is remarkable. It could be argued that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, Israel was only given to the jews because of this prediction, but even if that is the case it is still incredible to have predicted 3000 years ago that not only would the jews still be around but that they would be able to reclaim ownership of israel. \n\nIt is my belief that these predictions make a strong case for the truth of the torah. Not only did they come true, but they are predictions that did not make sense to make at the time, and would have seemed at the time to be very unlikely. The fact that they came true is at the very least a remarkable coincidence, and creates very strong evidence for the torah to be taken as truth. "}
{"title": "CMV: Healthcare and Education should be essentially free in an ideal society", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3df1t2", "selftext": "First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate.  \n\nMedicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe they should be free for several reasons:\n\n- One's health is essentially a genetic lottery. You shouldn't be punished because you were unlucky enough to develop cancer or be born with a blood disease\n\n- Health can be a direct result of economic conditions and people should not be punished because of the quality and quantity of food their parent(s) provide.\n\n- Education is essentially an economic lottery. If you don't have enough money to pay for college, good luck. Many people are only able to take out student loans because of a cosigner (or their parents outright pay it). Parent's don't have the credit? Your shit out of luck.\n\n- Education is the foundation for the future of society. Forget job opportunities for now, higher education provides valuable skills that cannot be learned anywhere else. By not providing equal opportunities, we are decreasing the intelligence of the population.\n\n- By educating the population, especially the poor, we will decrease crime as well. As of now, many poor kids know they'll never go to college even before they reach high school. By giving equal opportunity, kids will have incentive to stay in school and stay out of trouble. At least they *can* go to college.\n\n- By not providing free education and health care, we are putting our population into a deeper hole of debt, crime and stupidity. A smart and healthy population can contribute to society much more than the status quo (in America). \n\nEssentially, education and health are lotteries. Some get lucky while most don't. People should not be punished because of this. Investing money into an infrastructure that provides free education and health care is the basis for an advanced society.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One prominent example of this would be our freedom of press which was ranked at 150 out of 180 countries. My government response to this was that in order to maintain social and racial harmony control over the media was necessary in order to prevent racial riot and social tension from occurring which would in turn weaken our economy. Personally after seeing the Baltimore riots, i started to understand the rationale behind some of their actions as i would definitely do not want my country to descend into chaos due to riots. Furthermore, after starting to work i have come to the realization sometimes putting food on the table is more important than the rights we have.\n\n  In addition, to my surprise my government Media Development Agency (MDA) also monitor its people through the use of software provided by the Hacking Team( they have a company in singapore) . However, it seems like most singaporeans do not care if their country is monitoring their activities as i quote the common reply i get is '' I do not have anything to hide.So what should i be scared of?''

In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York. \n\nFirst, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. \n\nIt's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.   \n\nThe cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.\n\nThen there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited. \n\nI can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. \n\nTL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV. \n\n\nEdit: I'm well aware of the shitty aspects of Boston life; to me, NYC's bads are more...well, *bad* than Boston's, that's my point. Also, inb4 \"hurr Florida has bad things about it too.\" I definitely know that's true!\n\nEdit 2: FOLKS, this post isn't about \"Boston &gt; NYC\"; I'm well aware that there are bad parts about Boston too. Pointing out bad shit about other cities doesn't help make the case for NY. \n\nEdit 3: For everyone who keeps bitching at me about the delta I gave to u/whattodo-whattodo - READ THE FUCKING RULES. Quoting rule 4's explanation of delta: \"Please note that a delta is not a sign of 'defeat', *it is just a token of appreciation towards a user who helped tweak or reshape your opinion*. A delta =/= end of discussion\" (emphasis added). I've gotten so many replies to the effect of \"hurr, you're a law student and you gave up dat easy?\" Those people can choke on a phallus; I'm just giving credit where it's due, per the rules.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: America is already a police state, the public just hasn't admitted it yet.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ddcu5", "selftext": "Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through.\n\nEdit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help.\n\nFirst Amendment\n\nCops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.\n\n[Here](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/tag/journalist-arrested) are some stories about arrests of journalists.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nMost states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.\n\nFourth Amendment\n\nCops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.\n\n[Here](http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-rules-police-do-not-need-a-warrant-to-search-your-home/206199/) is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.\n\n[This](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.\n\nIt appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.\n\nFifth Amendment\n\nCops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.\n\nSixth Amendment\n\nYou can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).\n\n[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site) is an article about Chicago's secret prison.\n\n[Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.\n\n[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/deaths-in-jails-885-inmates) is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.\n\nEighth Amendment\n\nSome Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.\n\nI'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.\n\n[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.\n\n[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.\n\nEvery year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.\n\nIt might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?\n\nWell it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.\n\nIf you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.\n\nI'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.\n\n**Edited to link some sources**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Makeup is bad.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3dbzzt", "selftext": "I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. \n\n1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most of the reason women are given a reputation for taking ages to ready themselves, and given that I think it's unnecessary, it's actually a waste of time no matter how long it takes.\n\n2) It's harmful. Not only physically, where it may causes skin problems, headaches, premature aging, cancer, allergies, other skin diseases, and other things, but it can be harmful to the self-image of the woman wearing makeup, making them dependent upon the makeup, feeling ugly without it, etc.\n\n3) It's disingenuous. I think of it as false advertising.

{"title": "CMV: Donald Trump is exactly what the Republican party needs.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dbx77", "selftext": "Donald Trump and his campaign has been in the news for quite some time. He's been the butt of many jokes. Many think he is hurting the Republican party and their image but I think the other candidates could learn a lot from him and the way he is campaigning. \n\nThe main reason is because he is being unapologetic. What Trump said about immigration was not racist. He did not say Mexicans or people of Latino descent were rapists and drug dealers, he claimed there is a high percentage of crime from ILLEGAL immigrants and that the Mexican government shoves their criminals into the American jail and healthcare systems instead of dealing with them on their own. Now, I've looked and looked and found many conservative sources that back his claim and many liberal sources that refute it, but it is not a racist comment regardless of whether or not it is factually correct. He didn't say immigrants, he didn't say Mexicans or Latinos, he said illegal immigrants. \n\nMost political candidates would come out and apologize profusely and try to further clarify their point after such backlash but not Trump. Trump is standing by his words. The Democrats have been very good lately at painting their opposition as racist, sexist, etc. as a retort and Trump is not having it. He is taking the offensive instead of taking the defensive which both Romney and McCain did which is accredited to their loss.\n\nIf you look at the last presidential election, what were the candidates saying about each other? The Romney campaign painted Obama as a nice guy. He was the kind of guy you'd like to get a beer with and is a good family man, but he is an incompetent president and will lead us into financial ruin. What did the Obama campaign say about Romney? That he hates women, he hates gays, he hates Latinos,  he tied his dog to the top of his car, he fired some guy which then killed his wife, and he doesn't pay his taxes. Most people will vote for a good guy that screws up over a terrible awful person.\n\nTrump is not taking that stuff lying down. He's fighting back twice as hard. He's responding to his critics with twice the ferocity that they came at him with. The Republicans are not going to win if they continue to try and be the bigger person and not get down and dirty with the mudslinging that is American politics. The Republicans and their leadership have been sheepish ever since Bush's horrible second term and it is costing them elections and they are losing their base. \n\nIf you saw Chris Christie's speech, he blamed both parties for failing to compromise and for the state of the country. Do you see any Democrats blaming the Democratic party for anything and vowing to work with Republicans? That is not a strategy that will win.\n\nCheck out Trump's interview on NBC with Katy Tur. She constantly asks him leading questions about his offensive comments and Trump does not let her control the interview in any way. Many other Republicans would respond diplomatically in order to appear reasonable but Trump got it right. He stood by his words and didn't apologize. Do you remember during the Republican primaries of 2012 when George Stephanopoulos asked Romney questions about whether or not he supported states banning all birth control even though there were no states or candidates that supported that? Romney let him run all over him with that ridiculous question. Trump wouldn't stand for that shit and he would call Stephanopoulos out on that.\n\nThe Republicans were unhappy with McCain, with Romney, they are unhappy with Boehner and McConnell. They are losing their base of American conservatives. Trump is energizing that base and if more candidates took his approach, they could get conservatives back into the voting booths. Of course CNN, MSNBC, and CBS are going to trash him, they have always been much harder on Republicans than Democrats and anyone denying that is not being intellectually honest. He doesn't care. He's sticking to his guns which is what the Republican base needs.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: Ellen Pao was put on a \"Glass Cliff\" by reddit Co-founder Alexis Ohanian.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dbwmb", "selftext": "After reading [this comment in the recent announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3go9c), and reading [Bethanye Blount's comments in this article](https://archive.is/IQ0Ud) I am convinced that Ellen Pao, for all of the mistakes she made, was 'set up to fail' by the reddit administration and those above her, namely, Alexis Ohanian.  \n\nI have long since believed all of the decisions Pao made were not made solely on her own.  It was very convenient to blame this one person, but you do not do a 180 about-face turn regarding your company without the support of the other people who make decisions in your company, and without atleast some support of your staff.  Supporting my belief in these now very strongly are the remarks that came from Bethanye Blounts.  She was an engineer who joined reddit two months ago.  She was basically the one responsible for making all of the promises the admins made come true.  Here are her comments regarding the promises and Pao.\n\n&gt;\u201cI feel like there are going be some big bumps on the road ahead for Reddit,\u201d Blount said. \u201cAlong the way, there are some very aggressive implied promises being made to the community \u2014 in comments to mods, quotes from board members and they\u2019re going have some pretty big challenges in meeting those implied promises.\u201d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Blount also said she believed Pao\u2019s exit was an indirect consequence of gender discrimination, and that Pao was on placed on a \u201cglass cliff.\u201d **It is a term used to describe women being set up for failure by being placed in leadership roles during crisis points.**\n\n&gt;\u201cVictoria wasn\u2019t on a glass cliff. **But it\u2019s hard for me to see it any other way than Ellen was**,\u201d Blount said. She added though that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say my decision to leave was directly related to my gender.\u201d\n\nNow, I normally don't agree with most charges of sexism and misogyny.  Most arguments of \"glass cliff\" would have been outright dismissed by me.  You know what though?  I find it really hard to see this as anything but someone being set up to fail.  I find it really really fucking hard to sympathize with the admins here, and find it really really fucking hard to not blame *everything* on the reddit co-founder.\n\nBy the way, [Alexis is also the person responsible for Victoria being fired](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/3d2hv3/kn0thing_says_he_was_responsible_for_the_change/), aka, the person responsible for the blackout, and for the widespread vilification of Ellen Pao (she was vilified before, but it was not *nearly* as widespread.  The vilification was a spec of dust compared to the sandstorm of anger that followed Victoria's dismissal.)\n\nGiven this, I really really really can't see this as anything other than Ms. Pao being literally set up to fail.  For all of her own faults, *I think she was literally hired just so she could be dismissed or leave.*\n\nWill anyone here convince me otherwise?  Thanks.  I'll be here for a bit.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: The current pursuit of equality and its focus on income misses the bigger picture of wealth.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dbpfa", "selftext": "When people talk about inequality in America and other capitalist systems the focus is on income determining the wealth of individuals. Evening out people's income through taxing the rich and giving government assistance to the poor. It is my opinion that no lasting changes will be made to change the differences associated with different economic classes with this limited approach. How a person uses and saves money goes very far in determining their wealth and lifestyle they can live. Often good credit and smart savings can result in a more comfortable living than someone who makes a higher income but is irresponsible with money. Even if system worked and evened out incomes there would still be a sizable gap between those that knew how to use their money and those that didn't just as bad as there is currently.\n\nIt's similar to trying to solve Obesity by only decreasing the amount of food eaten. When losing weight cutting calories is very important, but exercise/lifestyle changes, balancing hormones, and proper nutrition all play a major role making people healthier and lose weight. Similarly wealth isn't gained simply by making more money, how a person saves and spends and uses their money is what makes wealth that lasts. A person may be blessed from birth with good genes or a family with money, but except in extreme cases (top 5% maybe) a person with bad habits will fail even with high income (become poor/ obese) and a person with good habits can succeed despite the disadvantage and a lower income. Hope that helped explain my view to allow it to be better challenged.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. \n\nMy friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the \"feminazis\" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. \n\nThis might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term \"feminism\" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the \"true feminists\" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. \n\nIn either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously.\n\nChange my view guys!"}

I understand that this is a touchy topic so I'm sorry if what I'm saying comes off as offensive. That is not my intention. My main reasoning is basically this.\nHuman life is incredibly valuable. It is a guarantor of all other forms of rights, or it at least allows for the possibility of other rights. As such the maximization of life should take precedence to other considerations, such as the right to choose whether or not you want to terminate a pregnancy. 80% or more of all pregnancies in the united states will be successful, and pursuing an abortion just decreases the amount of possible lives.\n\nTo clarify my point here is a thought experiment. Say you have a 2 year old child and a woman who is pregnant. no one would argue that killing the 2 year old is wrong. No matter how humanely it happens, you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable.\n\nAlso, the woman giving birth wouldn't have to take care of the child. contrary to popular belief, in recent years the number of children being put up for adoption has [steadily been decreasing,](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/15/us-adoption-domestic-waits-idUSBRE90E15Y20130115) while the time it takes for those who want to adopt a child has steadily been increasing, with some couples waiting up to seven years.\n\nAs a note my stance here has nothing to do with any sort of spiritual beliefs. Also I'm left leaning on most issues so it has nothing to do with party alliances. please CMV!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Piracy is largely indefensible and is base in a selfish desire for free entertainment.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dblnt", "selftext": "Darn typo\n\nEvery argument I see, in regards to piracy, is ultimately based in one and one thing only, a selfish desire for a free luxury, one that actively hurts small-time artists (not big corporations). \n\nI will begin by rebutting common pro-piracy arguments.\n\n1) *It doesn't hurt the artist!*\nEven were this statement true(it's not) it has nothing to do with morality(and thus, the legality) of the issue. It may very well help them, but it is without a doubt true that a pirate violates the owner's property rights, and the elements of the contract they sign.  Ultimately this argument can be ignore, because it is not just for someone to burn down another house just for petty revenge even if the ultimate result is a hefty insurance payment for the victim.\n2) *It's the freedom of information age!*\nNo, it isn't, since the information isn't free. Information isn't, nor should it be, inherently free. Classified military secrets, passwords, SSNs, browser histories, and credit card numbers are \"information\" but most certainly should not be given for free to anyone and everyone.\n3) *The poor wouldn't have bought it anyway. Besides, how do you expect me to pay for it?*\nAnother disregarding of morality, but let's address this directly. Information that is pirated, aka games, books, movies, etc. are luxuries. They are not necessities. Thus, while the poor may very well have not bought it anyway, they still violated property rights for something not in any way,shape, or form necessary for their survival or well-being. Stealing food, water, or money in order to purchase the former may, at times, be justified, but the theft of luxuries is not necessary for your survival. \n4) *We should transition to donation system.*\nThis is one of the more laughable positions I have seen and so often comes from the exact same people who argue that charity is not enough to help the poor(which they almost always claim they are). That argument, which I agree with, is especially true of art and copyrights. Why do you have to pay the electrician for the work he did to your house? After all, you never took anything from him, all he did was rearrange the bits in your house to work again, something you could of done yourself. All he lost was time, and that's not illegal to take, is it? So then why do we not hear of the same donation systems for blue collar workers like this? Because it's ridiculous.\n\nI am open to discussion on this. I can admit I'm wrong, but I just get infuriated with such selfish attitudes so common among supposed leftists; attitudes that are the catalysts for abominations like SOPA.\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: I worded \"Largely\" indefeasible deliberately.

{"title": "CMV: Iran will not attemp to build a nuclear weapon in the near future because the imputus for a nuclear deterrent - a threatened attack by the US - no longer exists.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3dbdvo", "selftext": "Back in the early 2000's, Iran had a good reason to want a nuclear weapon. They had been named as one of the three members of the \"Axis of Evil\" by president Bush. One of the other members was invaded and occupied by the US, leaving a massive military presence directly next door. Top level Republicans openly discussed the possibility of invading Iran. The President publicly refused to rule out the use of nuclear weapons in a war or aggression against Iran. If anybody had a good reason to want a nuclear weapon, it was Iran. The third Axis member, North Korea, actually had one, and was not considered a realistic invasion target for that reason.     \n  \nTheir fears of foreign invasion were real, and not abstract. Little more than 20 years before, Iran suffered hundreds of thousands killed, and over $600 billion in economic losses defending themselves from a US backed Iraqi invasion, which eventually involved offensive operations against Iran by the US navy, including the downing of an Iranian airliner, killing the 290 people aboard. During that conflict, 100,000 iranian soldiers, and an unknown number of civilians, were killed or wounded by iraqi chemical weapons. Iran did not deploy chemical weapons in the conflict. Any iranian over 30 is old enough to rember what total war is like. \n  \nNow that the US has made a comprehensive deal with Iran, they no longer have any motivation to acquire a nuclear weapon. They are capable of defending themselves against local adversaries, and face no serious threats against which nuclear weapons would be necessary.    \n  \nIf you actually want to change my mind, please don't bring up the fictional narrative of Iran as a suicidal state that would gladly see its 3000 year old civilization and 80 million citizens vaporized in an effort to destroy Israel.

{"title": "CMV: Reddit should ban whatever sub they want - they shouldn't have to accommodate for 'free speech'", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3db5i9", "selftext": "A lot of people seem to believe that Reddit should be a \"bastion of free speech\". I disagree with such view for several reasons. I believe Reddit should do whatever it wants to do regarding banning subreddits, restricting content etc for the following reasons:  \n\n1. Websites come and go - Whilst Reddit has been around for a while now, nearly nothing on the Internet is permanent. If people do really care that much about freedom of speech, they'll flock to voat or whatever other website pops up to fill the demand in the market. If enough people emigrate from Reddit, then it'll even whittle down Digg style. Personally, I feel even if there is a certain % of the userbase who leaves Reddit, I feel there will be a significant enough amount of people left to keep Reddit fully functional. Heck, it might even get rid of the nutheads and make Reddit a more pleasant place. \n2. The current downvote system doesn't guarantee open discussion anyway - The current downvote system is far from perfect. It might 'hide' the trolly comments but on certain subreddits, expressing a certain view will lead to a lot of downvotes and populist, sometimes circlejerky, comments often rise to the top. Many people use the downvote button as a 'disagree' button instead of a 'doesn't contribute anything of value' button. Can you really have an open, honest discussion in such environment anyway? \n3. Business reasons - I don't know about Reddit's financials in detail but it needs some sort of income. If they struggle to get advertisers due to PR reasons, Reddit should be able to do ban subreddits and limit content if they want to. Reddit is a private business afterall and not a public service. \n4. Majority of Reddit users don't give a shit - Now I have no proof for this and it would be interesting if there was some sort of poll. However, I genuinely feel the majority of Reddit users don't care whether Reddit bans certain subreddits. Like with many things, I feel there's a silent majority who really doesn't care about Reddit's user policy.\n\nEDIT: Adding to my second point, from the FAQ section of the CMV Wiki:\n &gt; Look, we kinda think downvotes suck. We want all interesting and thoughtful conversations to rise to the top, and the problem with downvotes is that it's perfectly possible for unpopular ideas to be interesting and thoughtful, yet many Redditors instinctively downvote claims they disagree with. The Reddit community has been accused of suffering from polarization and groupthink, and the voting system contributes to this issue.\n\nEDIT2: To clarify my POV: **We, as Reddit users, should let Reddit ban whatever it wants to**. I am not arguing from Reddit's (or the CEO's) POV. In hindsight, I would have worded the title better.  Whilst  points 2-4 stand if arguing from Reddit's POV, point 1 doesn't make sense hence the clarification. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: I believe that for people who are averse to sleeping with transgender people, the onus is on them to declare their aversions to their potential partners.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3d8t3x", "selftext": "Many times I've read statements from people who argue that transgender people should out themselves to potential partners who demonstrate an attraction to them, and if they don't they are somehow committing an offense against that person up to and including coercive rape. I feel that this position justifies prejudice and hostility towards transgender individuals. A very common reactionary comment is \"If I brought a girl home and it turned out it was a guy/she had a penis, I'd beat the shit out of them\", usually delivered with more provocative/offensive language. In my opinion, trans people shouldn't be obligated to out themselves to people who are transphobic, as that puts them at risk of harm. \n\nFrom my perspective, trans people exist. Trans people are also capable of being attractive to others, and being desired by others. I further believe that arguing that trans people have a duty to out themselves is predicated on a stereotype that no one would willingly choose to have sex with a trans person if they knew the person was trans. To me, that seems observably false (I've seen people in happy relationships with trans people) and contradictory in a way that suggests transphobic beliefs (if you can be attracted to a person right up until the point where you find out they are trans, then the argument that you aren't attracted to trans people is demonstrably false; after all, you demonstrated your attraction to them in the first place). \n\nI feel like the most honest position to take is to recognize that sometimes you may be attracted to trans people, rather than to refuse to acknowledge any attraction to trans people - because you can be! The situation of wanting to have a sexual relationship with someone, and then finding that they're trans demonstrates that you are perfectly capable of being attracted to trans people. In my opinion, if you don't want to have sex with trans people, then you are obligated to either tell your potential partners that you don't want to have sex with trans people, or you are obligated to ask them whether or not they are trans before initiating a sexual encounter. That way, trans people can decline a sexual encounter with you before it begins, without being forced to out themselves and open themselves up to the risk of violence.\n\nedit: Folks, a credible response to this CMV is never going to be found in \"Yes trans people are obligated to out themselves because lots of people are transphobic\". You are, in effect, stating exactly why most trans people are hesitant about disclosing, while affirming that you think it's fine to be transphobic because lots of other people are and why should any of you be forced to confront your own prejudices, after all, this issue that is somehow crucial information for you to know is for some reason not worth the bother to actively inquire about. I've read too many people's arguments about how they'd be 'psychologically traumatized', yet have absolutely no motivation or drive to avert that trauma in any way. This is not an argument. It's simply affirming that you're right because tradition/tyranny of the majority/laziness."}

My point is that responding to these events with anger - and not just with the feeling but the EXPRESSION of that anger - ultimately only makes the speaker and listeners feel more enraged, while doing nothing to learn more about the situation or make it better. \n\nAnger is a completely normal human emotion, and I'm not proposing that we become emotionless robots or not express our frustration. But generally speaking, the more anger we express, ultimately the less productive the conversation will be. \n\nPut another way - in a relationship, there is almost NO value in having anger toward your partner because it stifles communication and prevents each partner from trying to understand more about each other's actions. \n\nWe are all humans, nearly all trying our best to find happiness, and anger robs us of our ability to see that in others. \n\nCMV.

{"title": "CMV: The Slut/Stud Inequality Is Generally Justified", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3d6eeo", "selftext": "Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \u201csleeping around\", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. \n\nI want to make this point clear \u2013 I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.\n\nThe reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.\n\nGiven these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. \n\nOnce again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.\n\nTo illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.\n\nNow, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.\n\nThe difference between Bob and Patrick is this \u2013 Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.\n\nSo, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.\n\nNow, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.\n\nTo make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with \"crime.\" \n\nThanks!!!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Consciousness is most likely a fundamental property of our universe.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3d3llt", "selftext": "FINAL EDIT: Thank you for all your contributions. It's a very complex topic to properly debate over Reddit, but many of your arguments have truly shaken my confidence in my original idea. Dozens of new questions I had not considered arose during our debate, and these are questions I will take into consideration when I will go back to this topic to re-examine my current stance. If I find myself convinced I will assign appropriate deltas, but that would have to be at a later point (busy week).\n_______________________\n\nEDIT: I define consciousness as simply as just having an experience. 'Consciousness is the quality or state of awareness'.\n___________________________________________________\n\nConsciousness is most likely a fundamental property of our \nuniverse, as opposed to only existing after a certain complexity of arrangement of matter which we call sentient beings.\n\nThis statement has the implication of announcing plants, virus, rocks, dirt, stars and galaxies as conscious. \n\nI am aware that given the mysterious nature of consciousness, this is a topic cannot be proven either way. But it is still valid to have opinions and some opinions make more sense than others. This is my current stance on it which is very much up to debate.\n\nThese points all contribute to my belief. \n\n1. The only thing that can be known to be true is that there is such a thing as conscious experience. I cannot know for sure that anyone but me has a conscious experience, but I do know for a fact that I do. \n2. Our consciousness is associated with our brain. Certain part of our brain seems to exert certain conscious properties. Remove that part of the brain and what remains is still consciousness, but with fewer attributes. E.g. [this woman](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/12/16/meet-the-woman-without-fear/) who does not feel fear. It's just not part of her experience because her brain lacks that property. Is she less conscious than others? That's up to debate, but I would argue no; she just lacks attributes to her experience.\n3. Many have believed that consciousness is contingent upon sensory input. Can a person born without any sensory input whatsoever be conscious? Is there any experience to be had without senses? Maybe. Contemplatory people such as monks say there is. Regardless of what religion they're from - if any at all - they commonly speak of experiences of beyond all senses and feelings, just a state full of nothing which they can come back from and speak about. This proves nothing but it is interesting to think about. \n4. There is nothing about a brain that suggest that consciousness should exist. Scientifically, there is absolutely nothing connecting matter to consciousness. Consciousness is not subject to science at all at the moment. The implications of consciousness is subject to science, such as psychology and just even the act of preforming science. But doing science on consciousness itself is not possible at the moment. This suggest that either consciousness is beyond the scope of science, or that consciousness is remains undiscovered to science for the moment. To argue that certain arrangements of matter spontaneously creates consciousness is not a convincing argument. It makes more sense that all matter in general holds properties of consciousness - not yet discovered -, and certain combinations of matter only increases the complexities of consciousness giving it new attributes. \n5. There are studies out there that suggest that our own consciousness is just a combination of many (infinite?) different consciousnesses. Such as [this article](http://www.legiontheory.com/split-brain.html) where patients who had the information channel of neurons between their right and left hemisphere cut experience two separate consciousnesses controlling their body. Going in the opposite direction, [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/09/monkey-brain-net-raises-prospect-of-human-brain-to-brain-connection) describes how consciousnesses can be connected together and multiple beings can share one consciousness of collective knowledge and reasoning. This is not a hypothesis, it actually happens as you can read in the article. \n6. All these points shake the foundation of our intuitive feeling that consciousness is something strong and individual, personal and separate. Consciousnesses can be split to pieces, merged together and is actually very fluid. This all suggests to me that it is much more reasonable to think of consciousness as a fundamental property of our universe, and just like matter looks and behaves differently with different complexities and arrangements, there is all the reason to believe consciousness behaves the same. When we die, the complexities that our consciousness was subject to seize to exist, but the fundamental conscious property is still there.\n\nThose who argue that consciousness only arise after certain  arrangements of matter seem to be claiming something much more profound and illogical than what I proposed. Everything we know about our universe we have been able to boil down to fundamental properties. Why would consciousness act differently? Those who suggest so have the burden of proof, and until we know better it makes more sense to assume that consciousness is a fundamental property of our universe.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This usually stems from the observation that there are generally more political parties at play under Westminster parliamentary systems than is the case under the US's congressional system.\n\nBut this argument seems to break down when more closely examined. In particular, my biggest problem with it is that parties in a Westminster system are very different from those in a congressional system.\n\nSpecifically, parties in a Westminster system are far, *far* more homogenous and rigid than those in a congressional system. From what I've seen, under the former it is rare to the extreme to vote against your party while in the latter it is notable when a vote is split perfectly along party lines. To give an example, the \"Blue Dog Democrats\" are a subgroup of the Democratic party that often \"crosses the aisle\" to vote with the Republican party. As far as I can tell, that sort of behavior would be likely to get one kicked out of one's party in a Westminster system.\n\nIn other words, party discipline is much stronger in a Westminster system than a congressional system.\n\nThe strangest thing to me is that this homogeneity kind of appears to defeat the point of having parties in the first place - if the point is that the parties are voted into power and do not split their votes, then why bother to have many different MPs? Surely it would achieve the same effect if each party was just given a block of votes equal to the number of seats they would hold, no?\n\nThis all seems rather obvious to me, which tells me that I am most likely missing something significant or perhaps misunderstanding some key feature of the Westminster political system.\n\nFor the record, I am from the US and therefore far more familiar with the congressional system than Westminster systems, though I do try to understand both as best I can.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Again, I could be wrong, but this seems like a safe assumption.)\n\nIt also seems like this definition is not useful in any intellectually honest context in that all it does is silence those who are complaining about non-traditional discrimination by focusing instead on the presumed misuse of \"racism\" and not on the situation in which they experienced discrimination, invalidating their experience and confusing those who aren't necessarily familiar with it's usage by introducing a new definition.   \n\nI guess the tl;dr is basically the power+ discrimination = ____ism definition isn't useful outside of explaining that power and pervasive discrimination has more of an impact than simply discrimination and the way it's used isn't actually useful in conversation.\n\n**Edit:**  I'm dealing with the old exploding inbox and I don't have the time to fully devote to every question, especially not those that are repeats so this is my notice that I'll try to keep up but I can't make the same argument multiple times to different people.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The average serve for at the 2015 Wimbledon Finals for a Female(I saw the stat during a Semi-Final game) was 94MPH while the males was 124MPH. That's a huge difference, the fastest ever female serve was 131 while the males fastest serve was 163MPH, Cilic, Groth, Karlovic, Raonic, and Roddick all of those players average first serve is above [124MPH](http://heavytopspin.com/2011/10/13/us-open-serve-speed-by-player/).\n\n2. Females play best to 2 sets and men play best to 3 sets\n\n3. It was tested in Battle of the sexes tennis game where Bobby Riggs(Former number 1) at age 55 played 30 year old Margrett Court(Ranked 1 at the time) and she lost in straight sets. Note he latter played King age 26 who beat him at age 56,(He couldn't get any drop shots, but still forced a 3rd set.)\n\n4.

Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well I can go on and on. [Here is a list of 100 twists](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070836741/). \n\nIt usually consists of a plot that advances, but with hidden information not completely revealed yet. When the information is revealed, it will heighten the liking of the plot. It feels 'Mind blowing', the movie instantly goes deeper, it is suddenly a more complex movie, and twists are ideal for deep analysis and allegories. \n\nAdding a twist to a plot can make it everyone say 'Wow' and that one guy say: 'I knew it all along'. \n\nI think an analogy of showing why people like this so much, because it is abit like being in the plato's cave and then suddenly showing the light and deeper meaning. \n\nHowever, and this is my point, it is a simple and cheap way to make the movie much smarter than it initially was. I think there is also a high amount of plot twist movies in the IMDB top 250 (By no means a standard, but a good representative what is liked by movie-goers). Adding a well written plot twist makes a movie ripe for people to laud it, even though it is done to dead.\n\nBasically my point is that it is a too simple way to make a movie 'smarter' and an overdone method of 'blowing peoples minds'. It instantly adds points for movie-goers. \n\nAs I said in the title, my point is not that is a non-amusing 'plot device'. But it is a simple way to add layers in a movie. \n\nWhile watching a movie myself I always seem to like a twist (I thought Gone Girl did this very well and it sincerely surprised me) but afterwards when I am out of the cinema and more rational again I think 'hmm, just another twistmovie'. And apart from the twist nothing really interesting going on.\n\nA well regarded movie where I didn't like the twist was 'The Usual Suspects'. The cinematography and acting was obviously well done, but only looking at the plot I thought it wasn't impressive taking away the twist. I am probably triggering now a couple readers, for that I am sorry. However this is not a critique of this movie, but more of an example.\n\nI also think this is the reason why M. Night Shyamalan was so well recieved in the start of his career and now he is way less regarded than at that time. Because he does it all the time, and then it surfaces that it is a cheap movie 'plot device'. If he did it only once or twice people wouldn't have noticed it significantly. \n\n(I am sorry for spelling mistakes, I am not a native speaker)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence.\n\nEven bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being \"annoying\" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed.\n\nAnother reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop.\n\nAnother reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a \"tough on crime\" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient.\n\nWe punish people because we perceive them as \"deserving it\" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community.\n\nI actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.\n\nIn a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider \"bad\" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

In bullet form, here's why:\n\n* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.\n\n* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy.

There are many cases where the government is not doing its job in allowing for fair competition, but I am not speaking about these cases. I'm going to give a few scenarios, and I'd love if someone who disagrees could criticize the conclusions I make.\n\n- There are two pizza delivery companies. One of the company owners, Pablo, spent every night for the past 6 months figuring out how to optimize his business. He found better ways to incubate pizzas, better ways to stack pizzas in his pizza-mobile, and also found better ways to pizza his pizza. Because of this, more people are buying his pizzas. In the next year, Pablo earned three times as much as his competitor. Pablo sends his kids to public school, and has the same amount of kids as his competitor; he goes to the doctor when he is ill, and goes the same amount of times as his competitor; he's an American just like his competitor, and benefits from military defense in the same way; *why on Earth would Pablo have to spend multiple times as much money on these things than his competitor?* I really don't get it, I'm sorry. They utilize the same services in the same exact way, why is Pablo in essence *subsidizing* his competitor's payments just because Pablo is a smarter, more efficient businessman?\n\n- There's a marathon going on in Vermont. Two hundred participants compete for the $1,000 given to first, second, and third place. Each participant puts down $20, which goes toward prize money and ensuring the event is run well. Each winner splits the prize money. At the end of the race, the three winners of first, second, and third place are shocked to find out that they are only taking home $120. The event organizers apparently decided that the winners, despite working harder and simply being better at their craft, and despite equally paying for the organization of the event, should have to pay the other participants for simply existing.\n\nI just don't get it. If I drive to work and pass a bridge, I need to pay the toll because bridges cost money. Great. And perhaps I should pay in proportion to how much I drive, that seems like a good idea as well. But if I make a successful website that utilizes none of the services, and in fact very few services at all, is it not plainly *theft* that a bureaucrat decides where my EARNED money goes? I'd rather donate the money I don't need to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to environmental causes, to the cure for cancer, but the government seems to be stealing it from me so they can play live-action Battlefield 5: Real Life Edition. \n\nSomeone please explain what I am missing.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

And possibly, in addition to that, the US should reduce spending on welfare programs because the basic income would cover those costs, including medicaid and federal food stamp programs.\n\nMy post was prompted by a recent years look at suggestions to increase the federal minimum wage.  Bernie Sanders had suggested it.  Several states are working on it.  I saw one post that suggested we should increase the minimum wage because it is good for society.  The problem though, you increase the benefit for one group (the employee) and take away from another group (the employer), you essentially could double the employers cost for wages.  Why not vote on a basic income, all Americans will have to decide if that is what we want.  Tax paying Americans can pay for the basic income if we want it.      With minimum wage increases, you essentially put the onus on ALL employers that are currently paying minimum wage.  It could be a small bookstore in Idaho or a coffee shop in New York.  So I think we should remove the minimum wage and protect our society from poverty through a federal basic income.\n\nI would suggest that we do an \"opt-in income\", meaning that if you want the basic income, you can ask for it, no strings attached.  But, your other income cannot exceed the basic income.  For example, if you make 100k a year, you don't really need the possible 15-20k? a year basic income.    Or even if you make 20-30k, you are not eligible for the basic income.\n\nOn the removal of the minimum wage, I don't feel arbitrary wage rates set by the federal government is fair to the employer.  Ultimately it is the employer that desires an employee to work at their business.   A wage rate should be set between the employer and prospective employee.  If it is too low for the employee, don't take the job.  Or the employer should increase the wage to garnish more interest.\n\nHere are my current views and final summary:\n\n* A guaranteed  basic income would address poverty issues without a forced requirement on employers\n*  A basic income might save US tax payers with a reduction on other programs like Medicaid and food programs\n* A basic income would allow citizens the ability to train in new areas without worrying about income\n* A basic income would reduce the burden on employers\n* Removing the minimum wage is fair for employers and the basic income would mean that employees don't have to work at low wage rates.\n\nLibertarian case for basic income:\nhttp://www.cato-unbound.org/2014/08/04/matt-zwolinski/pragmatic-libertarian-case-basic-income-guarantee\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Then he lobbed a punch that knocked her flat  \n\n2) The stronger/larger person should show self restraint. Many of the same people who argue in favor of this phrase are also the same people who constantly argue about the physical differences between men and women. Is it not then hypocritical to expect fair fights?   \n\n3) I think all you need to do is check out how much people revel in women \"getting their comeuppance\" in these fight videos to see that they enjoy watching women get beat as if they always expect not to get hit back (ie. \"using their pussy pass\") when in fact I've rarely if ever seen videos where women are shown saying or expecting that.  \n\n---\n\nedit: since a lot of this discussion has centered around self-defense, I would like to link [this Sam Harris article](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-truth-about-violence) on de-escalating violence. I don't think we should be celebrating fights that start from *either party* escalating it further  \n\nedit 2: Not sure if this is relevant, but what brought this up is this: My concern is that whenever I see those kinds of comments, people claim that they're just interested in equality. But that doesn't sound right to me because of how 1) the fight is usually so one-sided, 2) you usually can't even show that the woman was using her \"pussy pass\", 3) I don't see much evidence that women by and large even think they can get away with violence because of their gender\n\n"}

Therefor I see the tactics employed by Tsipras and his party as cynical at best and downright reckless at worst - it's essentially been an effort to blackmail the Eurozone. As a result of this, I have sympathy for the Greek people as they will bare the brunt of the consequences from all this, but admittedly my sympathy is quite limited as they voted quite overwhelmingly in favour of supporting Tsipras when it was quite clear what could happen.\n\nAt the time of the referendum there were rallies in Scotland to support the 'No' vote, as well as France. These are areas with a very heavy left-leaning population (the SNP in particular in Scotland were also convinced that anti-austerity would work). Coupled with this, on Reddit I've seen a lot of people arguing that it is in fact not Greece's fault and the blame should be placed upon the lenders.\n\nObviously I do not agree with this standpoint as it paints Greece as some kind of foolish child who has no ability to look after itself. All this got me thinking - it is my view that those shifting the blame away from Greece do so to save face in the fact that the traditional left wing idea they may hold close - that of anti-austerity - has clearly not worked and instead has made things much, much worse.\n\nI believe that Greece's situation represents defeat for the anti-austerity platform as a whole and the left wing ideals it represents.\n\nCMV\n\nedit for clarity:\n\nMy view centres around the seeming unwillingness to accept that hardline left ideologies were not the correct answer here - an example of cognitive dissonance (in a way)"}

I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.\nThat said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word \"thinkpiece.\" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for \"the clickz?\") I have to believe that the right or, \"The Man,\" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.\n\nAm I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?\n\nEDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.\n\nTry not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.\n\nhttp://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003\n\nEDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  \n\nSomeone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.\n\nSome good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.

{"title": "CMV: The assumption that alien life exists is wildly optimistic", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3cvas1", "selftext": "Its pretty common to encounter people, including a decent number of reputable astrophysicists, who believe that the odds of life existing on other planets are so high as to be a near-certainty. These assumptions, as far as I can tell, tend to be based on the size and age of the universe (i.e. huge and old), particularly the number of \"earth-like\" planets.\n\nBut its my understanding that in fact knowing exactly how \"earth-like\" a planet is is pretty difficult, and that many planets listed as \"earth-like\" may not actually be earth-like in enough of the ways that matter--in other words, just because a planet is roughly earth-sized, roughly the right distance from a sun, and features heavy elements, doesn't actually mean that it in any way is earth-like *enough* to support life. In fact, it is entirely possible that planets which can support life are vanishingly rare, much rarer than most estimates based on \"earth-like\" planets seem to acknowledge.\n\nIn addition, the odds that a planet which does meet earth-like criteria actually will develop life are basically totally unknown--anthropic bias and the fact that we literally only have only one model planet to observe makes actually nailing down the odds of abiogenesis on some other, non-earth planet very difficult to estimate. And while it is true that abiogenesis seems to have occured roughly soon after conditions on earth met the necessary preconditions as we understand them, it is also my understanding that as far as we can tell abiogenesis only happened once on earth, with all life on earth ultimately stemming from a common origin. If abiogenesis were really common once the necessary preconditions were met, why hasn't it kept happening?\n\nTL;DR I think most estimates of the number of planets which actually meet the necessary conditions for abiogenesis (rather than just being broadly earth-like), and for the likelihood of abiogenesis occuring once conditions have been met, are very possibly way too high, and that it is just as likely if not moreso that both planets which can support life and abiogenesis on such planets are infinitesimally rare. While I would never say with 100% certainty that alien life does not exist, I am unconvinced by those who say it almost certainly does.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.\n\nExample 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they \"seem happy,\" or \"they don't run away\" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.\n\nExample 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with \"consent.\"\n\nSo that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!\n\nEdit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. \n\nEdit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong. This CMV is not \"convince me that bestiality is wrong\" or \"convince me that bestiality hurts animals\"; it is \"convince me that consent is a relevant concept when applied to animals.\"\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I think female teachers should not be judged as harshly as male teachers when they are arrested for engaging in sexual intercourse with their [teenaged] students.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3csz7p", "selftext": "[This](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3155546/Female-ex-Utah-teacher-36-sexually-abused-three-male-students-tearfully-begs-forgiveness-sentenced-30-years-bars.html?ito=social-facebook) is an adequate example of what I am talking about in terms of overly severe sentencing, however i'd love the discussion to be less about sentencing and more about societal judgement. As an example, of course she should never work in education again, but holy shit she shouldn't be rotting away for what is essentially a third of her life just for making 3 people extremely happy. \n\nWhy I think this:\n\nI'm a 27 year old male with a perfectly normal upbringing, a healthy sex life and in a healthy relationship of over 2 years. \n\nThere is nothing I wouldn't have done to get the chance to be intimate with one of my female teachers starting from year 5 right up to university. In my teen years, regardless of losing my virginity at 14 to my then 13 year old girlfriend, I was still completely infatuated with every mildly attractive person I encountered. I was a ball of hormonal clarity, not confusion, I wanted sex, and that was the extent of it. Whereas I feel women as a gender are not as predisposed to hormonal imperatives, so the base need for women does not exist anywhere close to the need that an adolescent man has to get the job done. \n\nTLDR: Adult male vs teenage female, not OK, they're not as into it as men, and the act itself is being driven by a pretty gross desire to bang someone, which they've then chosen to act upon a teenaged girl.  Adult female vs teenage male, what are you an idiot? Of course I'll bang you."}

We write laws and enforce them to protect us from harm. We pay taxes and build public services for the greater good of us all. We build schools because we believe everyone is entitled to an education. We don't do these things to help businesses or organisations prosper, we do them for the benefit of individuals within society. Despite this, it's considered acceptable (by some) for businesses to pay their workers less than *the living wage*.\n\nDoesn't this view validate the idea that the right of businesses to make money is more important than the right of the individual to make a decent living?\n\nI understand and appreciate the argument that some small businesses may not be able to pay their staff the living wage and make a profit. I don't think *profit is bad*, and I understand that jobs would be lost if small businesses didn't make enough money to get by. However, I don't believe the apparent risk of loosing jobs justifies exploiting workers. If taken seriously, the same argument would justify slavery.\n\nIf a business is run badly, or the demand for the product they produce disappears, I imagine everyone would agree that that business doesn't have the right to exist for its own sake. Surely we can agree that a business *must* exist on its own merits? Why then in a society that exists for the benefit of us all, do we think businesses that can't afford to pay workers enough to live have a right to exist? Why isn't fair pay for workers - enough for them to have a decent standard of living - considered a fundamental necessity of a healthy business?"}

I truly believe that the platform that has the greatest potential for story telling is video games compared with other methods (books, tv, movies,theatre) \n\nAllow me to explain; with video games, unlike every other method of story telling, you are in control of your character (besides cut scenes). You control where they go, how they fight, even the camera. \n\nAlso some games give you choices, sometimes big, other times small, for instance think of mass effect, you choose to save or destroy entire races and more importantly whether to allow your friends to die to do this. Compare this to choices in say Arrow (tv show, if you have seen it you know what I am referencing). While the choice is made there you have no input on it, it is filmed as that so will always be the same result. \n\nMoving away from story driven games to player created stories. There is an fps that I play called planetside 2, hundreds of players fighting over enormous maps. Here you get stories forming naturally, someone takes command, you might be fighting, surrounded on all sides desperately trying to hold a base until back up can arrive. Let me tell you, there is real tension created there and a connection to the people you are fighting beside (hard to explain unless you have played the game)"}
{"title": "CMV: the long division algorithm is obsolete, and should no longer be taught to schoolchildren", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3csjl0", "selftext": "A few decades ago, many schoolchildren learned [an algorithm for EDSRH](http://i.stack.imgur.com/Zccn0.png) (exact decimal square root by hand). This algorithm gives the exact decimal value (i.e. what a calculator would show you) of a number's square root, without a calculator or slide rule. Around 1970, this algorithm stopped being taught. Of course the square root itself is still in the curriculum, as is enough number sense necessary to _estimate_ a number's square root by hand, but EDSRH is out.\n\nSpecialists (e.g. calculator programmers) can of course still look up and learn EDSRH if they need it, so no knowledge is lost. But is it useful for enough students to be worth covering in classrooms? The consensus is no. Calculators are ubiquitous. If you need a square root, it's very simple to either _approximate_ it by hand, or find a calculator. You get by just fine these days without an exact method by hand.\n\nSure, learning EDSRH incidentally lets you practice other math skills like multiplication, but you could better use the same classroom time to practice those exact same skills while doing _useful_ problem solving.\n\nEDSRH is a remnant from a time before calculators, when humans needed to know how to be calculators themselves. Now that we have calculators that do the same thing (only faster and with fewer mistakes), humans' time is better spent learning to use calculators properly, and to do things calculators can't.\n\nYou probably see where I'm going with this. My view is that we've reached the same point with EDQH (exact decimal quotient by hand). You were probably taught an algorithm for EDQH around age 10: the most popular algorithm is [long division](https://www.mathsisfun.com/images/long-division-explained1.gif) (though there are others I feel the same way about). It's time to remove it from grade school classrooms. That time can be better spent training to use calculators, and getting enough number sense to make smart estimations and interpret calculator output well.\n\nFor context, I have a degree in mathematics, and I probably do more math on a daily basis, both professionally and as a hobby, than 98% of the population. I don't think I've used long division once in 10 years, and if I forgot it today, I wouldn't bother to relearn it.\n\nIn your reply, if you make an argument that could also be applied to EDSRH, please be explicit about why you think EDQH is different.

{"title": "CMV: College students are incredibly foolish, and deserve no pity for their poor decisions", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3csaui", "selftext": "In short, college students are absolute fools, and by and large deserve no pity for their stupidity. I understand what I\u2019m saying is very contentious but allow me to try and explain without sounding like an arrogant jerk (I\u2019ll fail, but whatever). One of the most frustrating things I see in the news is the ridiculous debate over \u201crape-culture\u201d on college campuses as if they\u2019re full of malicious serial rapists and murderers. Now, I\u2019ll admit I am a member of a large social fraternity at my school, a highly ranked university in California with ~40,000 students, so let the bias be noted. I want to first point out that this \u201cdebate\u201d is absurd, there is an imaginary opposition to the idea that rape and rape-culture is bad. You won\u2019t find rallies supporting rape or anyone (of course a few but exceptionally rare) suggesting that rape is acceptable. What the debate clearly stems from is the idea that rape and sexual assault is some liquid term with varying boundaries. A man having sex with a drunk girl is considered rape by some people and to be fine by others. Those saying it is rape see the opposition as suggesting any drunk girl is conscientious \u201casking for it\u201d and likewise those saying it is normal see the other side as suggesting being drunk rids you of responsibility for your actions. This creates an intense debate despite the fact that they all agree on the same fundamental principle. \n\t\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s talk about the behavior of college students. As I said before I am in a fraternity and the ridiculous nonsense I see every week of the school year is beginning to weigh on me. I have seen a girl give head on a dancefloor in our house surrounded by hundreds of people, I have been assaulted by random guys drunk as hell, I have had to physically remove several guys because they\u2019re pissing in the corner of a room. Of course, we\u2019re totally asking for all of this I suppose is the first thing that comes to most people\u2019s minds. We throw parties, we supply alcohol, we play the music and turn on the blacklights. Who am I to look down upon the result of my creation? And the answer is that I don\u2019t, if I didn\u2019t enjoy it I wouldn\u2019t be taking part in it. What bothers me however is the incredible entitlement and utter lack of dignity these people have. That girl I saw railing a line of coke and pounding away 3 shots out of a plastic handle? Oh it\u2019s her life, who are you to judge! That guy shattering a window on the second floor? Oh you shouldn\u2019t have given him alcohol, shame on you for throwing an unsafe party. \n\t\nWhat I have come to realize is that most students are absolute idiots, at least on the weekends. One caveat, yes I may just be around the wrong crowds, but I would say with complete confidence that at least a third of the student body engages in the type of idiotic garbage I\u2019m talking about. How does this relate to rape? If it isn\u2019t obvious, it is because I end up being the victim. These attitudes and opinions sincerely make me scared to have sex with a girl, because I know just being in a fraternity will make me guilty of rape before I can even open my mouth to defend myself. I find it unbelievable that there is such a stigma against, let\u2019s be honest, men in college. I have to hear about it all day, how dangerous it is to go to a fraternity party, how you\u2019ll get drugged and taken advantage of. Well let me tell you a vast majority of the girls found in these places will drug themselves before any guy even gets the chance. I see girls get black-out drunk and f**k anyone that looks their direction every other weekend and I ask myself, \u201cis this the same type of girl I see ranting and raving that just because she was drunk means she didn\u2019t consent?\u201d It is becoming increasingly hard for me to believe that they aren\u2019t one in the same. Okay, okay I\u2019ve been too anti-female, but believe me I think the guys are just as bad. I have heard of six people getting DUIs in my four years here in college. SIX DUIs, and a few drug related charges. What makes these people think this is acceptable is beyond me, but at least they will reap what they sow, I suppose.\n\t\nThis has probably been hard to follow, but I can sum it up pretty simply. While I\u2019m sure plenty are sincere, and my heart goes out to them, I find so many self-victimizing claims of college students to be farcical. At this point I just don\u2019t feel pity for the kid next to me in class facing a jail sentence for drug possession, or the girl freaking out because she is now known as the girl who banged five guys on the roof in one night. \n\nBeyond having pity I\u2019m angered by the fact these poor decisions end up being blamed on me. Let it be known to the world, because surprisingly no one seems to understand this, your university knows EXACTLY what happens at fraternity houses and they support it. They know underage drinking is everywhere they know the drugs are there. They know several of the fraternities \u201chaze\u201d and simply do not care. The police department knows as well, do you think they are ignorant of the massive weekly house parties? Knowing all of this and with absolute agency to stop these organizations from existing they allow it, because universities see the benefit in the greek system for promoting social events for students. Despite this, even if we don\u2019t serve alcohol at a party if some idiot comes drunk we\u2019re going down. We aren\u2019t offered the fair treatment bars or venues receive even though we serve the same function. The system basically works like this: The university knows well of all activities and events and they allow them while publicly stating they are against underage drinking, hazing, and the like. But if or when something goes wrong like let\u2019s say someone gets alcohol poisoning, the university and police department come crashing down on the organizations they support to save face and place all blame on the members. My reputation and life is under threat because I participate in something innocuous that is constantly scapegoated. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Your entire life gets determined by which class you happen to get born into. If the effect of this \u2018happenstance\u2019 could somehow be eliminated, so that everyone enjoyed equality of opportunity, then even though income and wealth inequalities continued to remain in society, this fact per se would not be a cause for concern. Access to larger income and wealth would then be determined not by \u2018luck\u2019 (of being born into a particular class) but by ability and effort. In fact, one can even go further: if the capitalist system could be so reformed that equality of opportunity for everyone could be ensured within this system itself, then even the continued existence of a group of people called capitalists and another group called workers, should not really matter. Needless to say, equality of opportunity in such a \u2018reformed\u2019 capitalist society must entail the confiscation to a significant extent, through death duties, of the property of the capitalists after their death so that their children do not enjoy an unfair advantage over others.\n\nEquality of opportunity is possible only in a society which can achieve and maintain full employment without jeopardizing work discipline, that is, only in a society where people work with discipline not because they are afraid of being consigned to the ranks of the unemployed but because they voluntarily internalize the need to work with discipline. This can only be a society where the workers collectively own the means of production. Of course, mere formal or juridical ownership of the means of production by the collectivity of workers is not enough to ensure that they internalize the necessity to work with discipline; they must feel part of a \u2018community\u2019 and transcend their individual self-interest as a condition for this.

{"title": "CMV: Biking is the most superior form of personal urban transport, and I think everyone should do it!", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3crlhd", "selftext": "Biking is the overall best form of personal urban transportation, and is vastly superior to cars, and even buses! Bicycles have a number of things up on cars especially: they're cheaper, easier to use, safer to use, more mobile, better for the environment, better for your health, better for infrastructure planning (a lot of cycling encourages dense urban growth to keep things accessible by bike), and I would argue they even make you happier! :)\n\n* Cars easily sell for tens of thousands of dollars or more, which makes them inaccessible for many people, especially the poor who cannot afford payments and insurance. Bicycles are much smaller and simpler, and so are cheaper to produce, easier to produce in large quantities, and therefore can be made very inexpensive very easily. This makes them accessible to everyone, even the poor! In fact, they're so cheap, you might as well make some of them public use bicycles that can be used by anyone!\n* Bikes don't need a lot of training to use. Kids can operate them just fine. They're that easy, once you get it, you know it!\n* Being smaller and operating at lower speeds, bikes are much safer in crashes, although they come with the disadvantage of being very exposed while riding. Bike safety and controlled speeds should be taught so that people know their limits, and roads should be well kept.\n* Bikes can be built very lightweight, and it's easy enough to pick one up and carry it when you simply can't ride it (such as at a set of stairs). This allows city infrastructure to have more diverse planning, and makes it easy to go off track to avoid traffic or problems on streets.\n* Bikes don't produce any greenhouse gases, and have non-harmful upkeep. Cars and buses produce emissions that are harmful to the environment, and require all kinds of shit to keep them running (oil, lubricants, wiper fluid, etc) They're also smaller than cars and require less materials to make.\n* Biking everywhere is great cardio, and is good for your legs. It often requires more effort than walking, burns more calories, and works your leg muscles more. And, it keeps your heart rate up, which is good for blood pressure and general wellness.\n* Cities that bike are built more dense and concentrated in lockstep. Amsterdam and Copenhagen are two cities that are infrastructurally modified to promote biking, and people there seem happier and healthier. High urban density and biking infrastructure also opens up a lot of economic windows for the poor. With cheap bikes, they'd be able to get to more jobs at less cost to them, which would reduce economic inequality and spur consumption, investment, and growth. \n* There's something that just makes you very happy biking. Going offroad and biking through a park is magnificent in the summer, and biking out into the countryside is a nice getaway from the city. The experience of biking is also exhilarating - your focus has to be on the whole time, so you're just experiencing everything with more urgency, and it's kinda cool to travel around the urban landscape like that.\n\nSo, I think biking is ultimately superior. Buses can obviously still be provided by those who need them, but most people should cycle. Trains are of course good in their own right too, but are not private transport that is as versatile as biking. (Of course, they should stay if they're already there, and probably expanded - to be bike friendly!) I want to hear an argument as to why I'm wrong, or be convinced of what other kind of private transport is better than biking. CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Genres are good and being very specific with genres is a positive thing.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3cqwqj", "selftext": "Something I see come up a lot in music discussion threads, whether on Sputnik Music , /r/Music, or even a more niche sub like /r/PostHardcore, is that being very specific with genres is an annoying thing. This is an especially large joke in extreme metal discussions where there are multitudes of different sub-genres.\n\nI think these are great. If you like a band with a specific sound and you want to find more bands like them your best bet is to search for bands in the same genre. Being vague or broad with genres is a great way to not find more bands like the ones you're looking for.\n\nFor example, say I like Protest the Hero and want to find more bands like them. They have a lot of influences in their style but could be chalked up into the umbrella genre of \"metal.\" If I search \"metal\" I will get a *ton* of bands that sound absolutely nothing like Protest the Hero. Even narrowing it down to \"Progressive Metal\" still gets a lot of bands that aren't very similar, like Opeth. But if I search for \"Mathcore\" which is a lot more specific I can find bands that sound a lot like them.\n\nThere's no reason for the disdain of genres. No one complains about when movies get a million genre tags ([Example](http://i.gyazo.com/03027ec62e9f2efce7990a56ad3c79e2.png)) but when bands do they get annoyed and I can't see why. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: America should dissolve in a Velvet Divorce", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3cpeym", "selftext": "In the early 90s Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved in the \"Velvet Divorce\" into two separate countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I like that they split the name evenly as well.  They divided the national assets by population and want their respective ways.  While there have been some hiccups, by and large both countries are doing fine. \n\nI think America should undergo a Velvet Divorce of its own.  First the how, then the why. I'd like to focus on why it's a worse outcome than the current course of the country, rather than on the problems with execution (which are admittedly huge).\n\nThe How:\nEach political party designs a policy platform for their own country.  Everyone votes in a \"primary\" referendum for the various platforms, and the two platforms with the most votes advance to the general referendum. Based on the current U.S. political situation, Democratic and Republican platforms are likely to win top-two. (If we want to do more, we can, but it seems like 3rd parties would still benefit)\n\nIn the general referendum, every state holds a vote between the two platforms. The majority decides which country the state will join. \n\nThe likely countries we'll call the \"United States\" and \"America\". These are short-hand for the more liberal/Democratic country and the more conservative/Republican country, respectively. They're likely to look somewhat similar to the last few presidential elections, though with perhaps some defectors in either direction, depending on which country the states see as the real successor to the USA. \n\nFor five years, the government plans and executes the division of itself, the national assets, and national debts by population.  Anyone who wants to move from an area that will be in one country, to an area that will\nbe in the other, will receive government assistance to move.  (I would predict an exodus of African-Americans from \"America\")\n\nAt the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states. \n\nThe Why:\nIt's apparent to even casual observers of American politics that The USA is a nation divided, mired in gridlock. The result is a non-functional government in which no one is satisfied and major policy initiatives are tortured into Frankensteinian monstrosities to pass (Obamacare). \n\nAmericans have already begun to segregate themselves politically and we've seen a real deterioration of moderate politicians in both parties, who normally could help bridge the gap and find compromises.  \n\nThis stagnation is hurting the USA both at home and abroad. Significant domestic policy challenges are going unaddressed on the federal level (climate change, loss of the middle class, deterioration of transportation infrastructure, tax reform, cost of higher education) and as a result, the USA is losing ground against other countries economically. \n\nSo instead of constantly tripping over each other, screwing up each other's plans, etc, why not divorce?  The \"United States\" can try every left-wing wacko policy it wants, \"America\" can finally do all the nutbag conservative things it wants, and in thirty years, we see which country is the better for it?  Could it really be worse than the partisan gridlock that is dragging the USA down?\n\nProblems with this idea:\nThere are a lot, so I'll highlight some big ones on the procedure side and the effect side. \n\nMilitary:  Each nation would be nuclear-capable and have procedures and armaments the other side is familiar with. This means duplication of key assets (two NORADs, two Pentagons) and that new procedures will have to be developed to ensure neither has the advantage over the other. The \"United States\" might also suffer significance military brain drain to \"America\" due to the average political inclinations of service members. \n\nWorld Economy:  The world economy would go into recession as the world's biggest economy divides and both countries struggle with the inherent inefficiency of two economies where there was one.  Especially if either side enacts trade barriers to the other. \n\nRace to the bottom:  \"America\" would probably remove or reduce labor, environmental, and health and safety laws that are considered bad for business, making it more attractive for capital investment.  This would undermine the \"United States\"economy and progressive policies, as companies can get the same workers for cheaper. \n\nGeography:\n\"America\" would be continuous and vaguely similar to the Republican \"L\" of the south and midwest, with the \"United States\" split between the west coast and northeast.  This is not conducive to the survival of the \"United States\" as an intact entity, I'm not sure there's a nation that's been divided into two parts that has survived very long. "}

{"title": "CMV:The way women are portrayed in video games has no negative effect on society", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3cp5ze", "selftext": "I\u2019m a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find silly/trivial. I\u2019m currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There\u2019s really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach.\n\nWhen I won the grand prix my girlfriend said \u201cUgh, I hate Peach, she\u2019s such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.\u201d To which I jokingly replied \u201cWow, that\u2019s a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she\u2019s obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.\u201d And her response to that was \u201cPeach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.\u201d\n\nThen I made the mistake of saying \u201cWell I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life.\n\nThere were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don\u2019t need no man: Samus, Rosalina, Zelda/Sheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it\u2019s still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn\u2019t be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal.\n\nThe second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They\u2019re imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-33466-001/). Most reasonable people realize that women don\u2019t wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtle/dinosaur hybrid.\n\nI provided my argument, and also said if Mario\u2019s and Peach\u2019s roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was \u201cYou won\u2019t ever understand because you\u2019re a guy.\u201d I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: \u201cYou won\u2019t ever understand because you\u2019re a guy.\u201d\n\nSo here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I\u2019m more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video games/stories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? \n\nEDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than \"It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt\"\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It's not markedly inferior to google, and in many ways it is better. Specifically in its video searches.

You can try this yourself, Google \"Kill la Kill opening 2\" in both Bing and google, and see which one is easier to find the actual non-altered intro video. being able to preview the video in the window is a nice feature, and the video browser is especially good for porn, as it takes away the need to actually visit the specific websites and streamlines and aggregates the whole process.\n\nIn general, it feels as though Bing has become stigmatized to other things like Comics Sans, or Nickleback, which have become more \"fun\" to hate, but the repulsion they face is disproportional to their actual lack of quality.\n\n\nBasically, I think Bing is not as bad as people say, and in some cases is preferable to Google.

{"title": "CMV: Socialism/ Communism will not work in today\u2019s society because people are selfish.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3cntuq", "selftext": "Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:\n\nFirst, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were \u201cmore equal than the others\u201d. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people\u2019s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. \n\nSecond of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. \n\nAll in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.\n\nEdit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Hiragana are superior to Kanji", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3cm4z2", "selftext": "By superior, I mean more practical/usable as a writing system. I do not mean to argue about the aesthetics of the two writing systems. \n\nBackground: I am a weeaboo, so I elected to take Japanese for my college language requirement (3 quarters). I don't feel like I have all that great of a grasp of the language, but grade wise I received 3.9, 3.9, 3.8 so its not as if I am just completely awful at it. Towards the end of the course though, I found Kanji to be frustrating. Early on we learned simple kanji such as \u4e00, \u4e8c, \u4e09, \u4e0a, \u4e0b, and \u4e2d (these mean 1, 2, 3, above, under, and inside respectively). With these it wasn't had to see how the character corresponded to the meaning. Towards the end though, we were learning kanji with many strokes to express one syllable, and I couldn't see any connection between the kanji and the word - take for example \u52c9\u5f37 (to study). With this, let me outline my points\n\n1. It is easy to entirely memorize Hiragana, and difficult to do so for Kanji: There are ~50 Hiragana, and ~3000 Kanji. Just by numbers, its clear that the former would be easier to learn. Kanji characters in general being more complex than Hiragana ones compounds this issue. Even native Japanese speakers study Kanji through highschool. Furthermore I'd wager a lot of the more complex Kanji don't seem to be very tied to their meaning. This is to be expected given that abstract concepts, colors, etc are difficult to express through said strokes, but even if its to be expected, it still increases the difficulty of memorizing Kanji\n\n2. Hiragana directly correspond to how something is pronounced, Kanji do not: This has several benefits. If you know how to pronounce a word, then it is simple to write it in Hiragana, not true for Kanji - you have to have memorized the Kanji. Furthermore, say you are reading and you come across a word that you don't know. There are two cases - either you can guess the meaning of that word from the context, or you can't. I argue that it is better if the word you don't know is written in Hiragana. With Hiragana, you can simply type out that word and search for it, either verifying your guess, or learning what word it is. With Kanji, it is harder to search precisely: since you don't know how the word is pronounced from reading a Kanji you don't know, you can only search for 'your guessed meaning + kanji' and see if they are the same. If the sentence has multiple possible meanings, or your guess of the meaning was wrong, you are simply out of luck: Consider a sentence like \"X event occured, so Y person felt ___\". Without knowledge of Y's thoughts regarding X, any number of emotions could fill in the blank, and so searching by meaning isn't going to be effective.\n\n3. While Kanji may use fewer spaces/characters to express a word, it makes writing things more time consuming. Say you wanted to write Sunday. In Hiragana this is \u306b\u3061\u3088\u3046\u3073\u3001in Kanji this is \u65e5\u66dc\u65e5. While the Kanji is 3 characters rather than 5, the middle character which replaces \u3088\u3046 is a large number of strokes, it is faster to write the hiragana, and the tiny strokes in that Kanji make it difficult to write or read when you want your text to be small. \n\n\nDisclaimer: My argument isn't predicated on any hard statistics or linguistic background (I have never taken a linguistics class, don't have the room for one in my course plan), just on personal thoughts. However, if you do have input for the argument in the form of relevant statistics, or the perspective of someone studying linguistics, then I'd appreciate hearing it. However, if you don't have \n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The rest of my courses were electives. In fact, I took as many psych courses as they would allow, getting special permission to specialize, and it was still less than half. Upon graduating, I found out that most masters programs don't require you to have your bachelors in their subject, as they are basically teaching you from scratch (some will add one extra year if you are from a totally different discipline). Why can't the solution to be to push for less extraneous courses in college? It would lower the debt (less years) and allow you to join the workforce earlier.\n\nPrime examples: Law school can be entered with any degree, Medical school requires a single years worth of prerequisite sciences and any degree, Masters of psychology can be done with any degree, Computer science Masters will require only 1 additional year if you have no background...\n\nI feel like I am missing something obvious here.

{"title": "CMV: I'm a Liberal and I think illegal immigration is actually a problem.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ckb3d", "selftext": "In light of Trump's bigoted comments recently making the news, I thought it might be a good time to post this. It seems like some portion of the media has the attitude that any objection to illegal immigration is inherently bigoted.\n\nI believe illegal immigration is actually a genuine problem. I'm aware America in it's current form is a country of immigrants. I fully support legal immigration.\n\nI don't believe the stock line that modern immigrants are fulfilling jobs that otherwise broke, unemployed Americans could not or would not perform. That idea is inherently racist when you think about it. It says one group of people are capable of performing a task that another group cannot simply because of their identity. I'm not saying that immigrants don't perform these jobs very well, but I see no reason to think that Americans and legal immigrants couldn't perform these jobs equally well.\n\nThere are plenty of unemployed Americans who aren't able to land jobs because illegal labor costs are very cheap. Companies that employ illegal labor have a significant incentive to keep this cheap form of labor in play, at the significant expense of regular Americans who want to be payed a living wage. Instead of having to pay a decent wage, these companies can get away with exploiting illegal immigrants for their cheap labor. If this wasn't allowed, if the laws preventing illegal labor work were actually enforced, there would be significantly less incentive for people to migrate to the US.\n\nIf you're in the Midwest or East, you don't really notice the amount of illegal immigration that's going on. But, if you're in the West, it's hard not to notice. Obviously it's hard to tell who has migrated here legally and who hasn't, but if you visit a Latino grocery store the size of Wal-Mart you'll notice a few things...they're all extremely busy, many of them don't speak English...which makes me think they're either visiting or have not been here very long.\n\nObviously this is a generalization, but it seems like every family has about 3+ kids. It's not at all uncommon to spot families with 5+ kids under the age of ten. How is this possibly a good thing? There are enough humans polluting our country as it is. Why increase the burden?\n\nMost intelligent people have started to have less children, yet these religious people who are, on the whole, even less educated than we are, show up without decent paying jobs, take jobs that other Americans would have taken and now can't take, and proceed to have an expensive amount of children while having full access to our underfunded public school systems, our hospitals, and generally putting a ton of stress on every public service imaginable (libraries, jails, roads, landfills).\n\nIf their kids are sufficiently indoctrinated from a young age in the Catholic religion and adequately against birth control, will they proceed to have as many kids as their parents when they reach child rearing age? For every 3 kids another 3 kids? Is America not sufficiently religious as is? Do we need more religious believers strolling around attempting to inject dogma into our government/culture?\n\nMeanwhile, since these people are showing up with nothing, their kids are often receiving the worst of the worst in terms of education and healthcare. What are the long term effects of that? Not only is the educational system more stressed with these ESL kids, but these kids aren't being adequately educated. Does America have a shortage of unintelligent people? Do we need to create more by putting undue pressure on the educational system? What are the long-term effects? How could they possibly be beneficial and not negative effects?\n\nThe media and politicians have a huge incentive to support and bend over backwards to their new huge audience, so I don't trust them to be at all honest in their discussion here.\n\nAgain, how is this possibly a positive thing? Why encourage it in the slightest? Are there not enough problems going on in America that you want to compound the problem by adding more people to the equation? More people means more complexity...complexity isn't usually a good thing because it does not make things easier. I don't see the benefit whatsoever. Let a regulated amount of the best and brightest people come here legally and get paid decent wages. Let Americans have jobs that pay decent wages.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Business workflows that still involve physical papers in an office usually exist not because there isn't a complete digital solution on the market to replace and streamline the process, but that an effort to research and implement that solution has not yet been prioritized.\n\nA great deal of office communication is done by email or over the phone. Communication which is done in person usually stems not from necessity, but social instincts from being obliged against your wishes to share a physical space during a certain time of the day as a condition for employment. If employees want to see each other during meetings or one-on-one conversations, there are tools like Skype to do that.\n\nWhen office jobs only include work  that can be accomplished anywhere with a laptop and internet access, and necessitate communication that can all be accomplished through email, phone, webcam, that job has the capability to be done completely (or at least partially with little exception) remotely.\n\nTo accept this premise about most office jobs, and to agree that a great majority of people would be fully willing and extremely happy about the flexibility to do some or all of their work from home or a location of their own choosing, I am left to conclude that businesses with these jobs have an ethical obligation on the part of owners and upper management to dedicate as much working time as necessary (that doesn't interfere with the company's livliehood) to researching and implementing a flexible remote work option for all personell completely or partially capable of performing their duties from any location with phone and internet access.\n\nIn 2015, company owners, directors, and mangement in a position to implement remote working flexibility for their employees that refuse to do so are probably lazy at best, and at worst are also abusing their leverage as the employer in a job market by persisting the now archaic model of the office, and are being inconsiderate towards possibly increasing their employee's happiness exponentially.\n\nEDIT: There's been a lot of good discussion here, and I am convinced to add that reluctance to adopt remote work options is not limited to laziness. It can also come from stubbornness or aprehension on the part of management, particularly when it consists of baby boomers, or a belief that adopting a fully remote work plan will have negative impacts. I still maintain that employers should feel some sense of obligation to at least explore the topic and come to an informed opinion on what remote work options can be offered at their company."}

{"title": "CMV: The tax on rich people is way too high and is therefore unfair.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ch2dc", "selftext": "People always talk about how rich people (i.e. mega-millionaires and billionaires) are not paying their \"fair share\" in terms of income taxes. They say how the tax rate for the rich should not be smaller than the tax rate for those who are not rich. But even if there is a great disparity in tax RATES, the AMOUNT of taxes that a mega-millionaire or billionaire has to pay is still greater than the average person's. For example, an income tax rate of 10% on a person making 10 million dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 1 million dollars in taxes, but an income tax rate of 30% on a person making 100,000 dollars a year means that that person would have to pay 30,000 dollars*. Even though the millionaire has a lower tax rate, it's not fair that he/she has to pay 1 million dollars in taxes while another person only has to pay 30,000 dollars. There shouldn't be a penalty in the form of tax for people who make a lot of money; it's simply not fair. It's also not democratic because while each person only gets one vote, the richer person gets a greater financial obligation to society than the average person.\n\n*I know this isn't how tax rates works but let's assume it is for simplicity's sake."}

Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out.  It's a disability that a person does to themselves.  It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability.  However, I still think it's a disability because it makes it harder to perform every day tasks.\n\nHere's a comparison that I use.  Imagine you cut off your leg with a hacksaw, for no good reason.  You're now missing a leg, and I would consider you to be disabled.  You did it to yourself, and you could have made different life choices to avoid becoming disabled, but you are disabled all the same.  You might argue that someone who cuts off their own leg obviously has some mental issues, but that could be said for a person who allows themself to become severely obese.  For example, depression leads to overeating for many people.\n\nSo why should obese people be denied some of the \"benefits\" of being disabled, just because they did it to themselves?\n\nAnd I hate that I feel like I have to even say this, but no, I am not overweight, and I do not have any personal agenda.

I went to the zoo with the SO yesterday (both in our mid 20's) and the amount of babies there (children under 1.5 years old abouts) was incredible. They're howling all over the place which is a no-no for most zoo patrons as it disturbs and can scare the wildlife. Why the fuck would you bother not only the other zoo patrons but the animal wildlife by bringing an infant in a place they can't comprehend or remember? I had finally had enough at the chimpanzee habitat when a baby in a stroller started screaming his head off which totally freaked out all the chimps. Chaos ensued within the habitat. It's just disrespectful for everyone involved. \n\nEDIT: I'm going to highlight that this is *not* about generalized babies crying in public spaces. This is very specific. If you have an infant, what is your thought process on not moving away from an animal enclosure when your child is screaming, disturbing the animals, and there are signs everywhere that say \"NO LOUD NOISES\". \n\nTL;DR babies screaming at a restaurant is a-ok in my book. Babies screaming, freaking out animals in a \"Quiet Zone\" and not being removed from the premises is most assuredly not a-ok. "}

As such, the success of a franchise is dependent on the supporters who pay money for tickets, gear, etc. If we were to look at attendance figures for the National Woman's Soccer League (NWSL) for 2014 compared to Major League Soccer (MLS), we see a huge disparity in people attending games. \n\nOf course, this translates over to other leagues. The NBA draws more people than the WNBA, both live and TV ratings. The revenue of the NFL is exponentially greater than the Independent Woman's Football League. \n\nI'm not here to provide solutions to this, or look into why the mentality of America draws more into guy sports.

If a bomb went off, we were able to look back at that area to find who planted the bomb, and then follow that person or group to wherever they ended up in order to arrest them.

If minimum wage were raised to $15 per hour, all of my efforts to become a more valuable worker have been in vain.  My current salary would be barely more than minimum wage.  Soon after the minimum wage increase, inflation would revert me back to my previous quality of life.\n\nTherefore, there is no reason that me or anyone who makes more than $15 per hour should support a minimum wage increase.\n\nEDIT:  There have been a lot of people who have mentioned this, so let me say it here.  I know that an increase in minimum wage does not correspond to a 1:1 ratio of inflation.  The actual amount of inflation doesn't factor into my opinion.  It doesn't matter if the inflation increases my cost of living by 50%, 5%, or .01%.  The fact remains that my cost of living will have gone up, and my salary will have not increased.\n\nEDIT2:  I'm getting tired of addressing this individually so I'll address it here.  I know that for people making minimum wage, it would help them out.  I know that it's hard to survive on minimum wage in America.  But that isn't what my opinion was about.  It's about how it would affect people who make more than the newly proposed minimum wage.  I'm not here to have a discussion about how I should feel bad for the people struggling to make ends meet.

But this seems to be a flimsy justification at best.\n\nOf course, you could argue the practical limits and problematics of abolishing the advertising industry, but I'm not asking about that, but about the \"morality\", for lack of a better word, of advertising.\n\n**EDIT: The counterarguments mostly boil down to \"advertising is good because it informs the customer\" \"if advertising were not there you would have to pay for a lot of services like youtube, TV\" \"limiting advertisement is limiting free speech\"**\n\n**I don't agree with any of the three points above. I am sorry that I don't have more timeto discuss this individidually with every one of you, but my views are:**\n\n* Advertising isn't good because it informs the customer what product exists. That is a ridiculously unfair and unefficient system of informing the customer which products exist. It is not  fair that some products inform more people of their existence because they can shell out more money on ads. I believe a better system could be implemented.\n\n* Saying that you would have to pay for currently free services is not true too. You ARE paying them, with your time, by watching ads. And your time watching ads is DEFINITELY less valuable than 8$ per hour, which is min wage. So, it is much more efficient to pay for these services by selling your time to McDonalds/your current employer.\n\n* Limiting advertisement is limiting free speech. This one is less clear. You can argue that limiting advertisement is limiting the actions of individuals and thus limiting free speech. On the other hand, by limiting the speech of big companies, we are making the speech of small companies louder, which IMO increases overall \"free speech\". Regardless, I have a utilitarianistic worldview, and so I don't really care much about limiting free speech if it provides more value to society as a whole. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: An increase in the minimum wage would hurt only the lower and middle classes", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3cemxp", "selftext": "Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to $15/hour. While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help.   \n  \nThese company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: \n  \nThe first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing. \n  \nThe other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retail/restaurants). With increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. Practically all people get there basic necessities and luxuries from retail and grocery stores- the lower and middle classes especially rely heavily on major stores such as Walmart or Target. Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck. \n  \nWhile ideally an increased minimum wage seems perfect, it would in reality end up creating a combination of these two things. I'm sure I didn't hit on some points, so please try to change my view on this, I, as a minimum wage employee myself, would love to have a good reason to support raising it.\n\nEDIT: \u2206 Okay, my views been changed. I still don't think something as drastic as upping it to $15/hour right away would be a good idea, but I think a gradual increase could be really good. The biggest things that helped my view change were the historical instances of MW rising, the average proportion of price increase vs. wage increase, as well as the fact that businesses are already operating with the minimum number of employees and that jobs wouldn't just become expendable. I really wish I could reply to more comments but I can't at the moment, thanks to everybody who replied!"}
{"title": "CMV: We should really be eating less meat", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ce8i4", "selftext": "I decided to write this here because it's hard to have this discussion anywhere on reddit without getting low effort, kneejerk responses like: \"found the vegan\" and \"for whatever animal you don't eat, I'll eat three!\" If you're going to write that type of response... please don't.\u00a0\n\n\nI'll also preface this by saying that I've been a vegetarian for more than a decade. I know how off putting a preachy vegetarian can be as I know a few (in my experience the preachiest ones are usually the ones that have been vegetarian for a short amount of time or the ones that take to veganism with a religious fervour), but I will be respectful and hope my arguments are judged only on their merits. To start off:\u00a0\n\n\n1. I don't judge meat eaters or push people to stop eating meat altogether, but I am open to discussing vegetarianism with people who ask.\u00a0\n\n2. I don't expect the entire world to stop eating meat, all I'm asking is that we cut back (a lot).\u00a0\n\n3. I think there are situations where it is okay to eat meat, such as subsistence hunting/farming.\u00a0\n\n\nMy responses to popular arguments I often hear *for* eating meat:\n\n______________________________________________\n\n**Appeals to Nature**\n\n\n1. Humans are omnivores; we evolved to eat meat. We need meat to live.\u00a0\n\n\n**Response**: Being an omnivore doesn't mean one has to eat meat. We are capable of surviving on a large variety of diets, some of which contain meat, others do not. The important thing is being able to meet our nutrient and vitamin requirements. In the developed world we have access to such a wide variety of foods that it is completely reasonable to be a survive on a vegetarian diet with minimal effort (and scientists agree). A vegan diet is also possible, though this diet requires more foresight and planning.\n\n\n2. We are at the top of the food chain, therefore we should eat meat.\n\n\n**Response**: I also have a driver's licence but that doesn't mean I *have to* drive. I would also argue that those of us living in the developed world *are not really part of the food chain* as not only does our existence not hinge on the whims of the natural world in our immediate vicinity in any way, through technology we are completely removed from whatever ecosystems we live in to the extent where we can be just fine without having to know the first thing about survival in the wild. The majority of humans in the developed world have never hunted or fished nor do they even know how to exist in the natural world without leveraging technologies to soften the impact of doing so. We also have zero predators or prey in any of our human controlled environments unless we willingly remove ourselves from these environments to go and looking for them.\n\n\nAlso we have an opposable thumb, the capacity for abstract thought, and therefore the ability to shape the world around us. That gives us an unfair advantage over every other species on the planet.\u00a0\n\n\n3. The Circle of Life (animals are jerks and kill each other all the time--why shouldn't we join in?)\u00a0\n\n\n**Response**: Because we're too good at it. Other sentient beings don't have the power to raise entire species in captivity and harvest them over and over again once the meat is *just right* for selling/eating ad infinitum. I think the fact that we're capable of making tools at a scale where we can basically sculpt our environments to our liking and removes ourselves from nature to the point where we can lead abstract existences that are incomphrensible to any species living on this planet comes with some responsibilities, like that we should avoid dispensing suffering upon any form of sentient life when possible and we shouldn't shit where we eat, ie: wreck the planet to the point where we can't live here anymore.\n\n4. Vegetarians/vegans indirectly kill animals anyway, it's unavoidable\n\n**Response**: Yes, that stupid Maddox argument has been sent to me a dozen times between 1998 and now. It is true that vegans/vegetarians are indirectly responsible for the deaths of animals, particularly vegetarians as we still eat some animal products. Does that make the diet not worth doing? Hell no! My meat consumption is extremely low as the only meat I eat is accidental. I don't believe it's possible to completely avoid the suffering of animals, but I do seek to minimize it as much as is possible. \n\nPeople get too hung up on the titles \"vegan\" and \"vegetarian\". It's better to see them more as goals we should strive for or standards we should hold ourselves to, not a binary state like \"believer\" or \"nonbeliever\" that we need to cling to. \n\n\nArguments for reducing meat consumption\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\n**Environmental**\u00a0\n\n\nLivestock cultivation is a huge contributor to greenhouse gases which is increasing as economies like China and India develop and the demand for meat in those countries increases. I believe livestock cultivation accounts for between 12-15% of greenhouse gases (of a total of %18 for agriculture), which is more than transportation. Also, cow farts (seriously) and animals that rechew regurgitated food are responsible for releasing two billion tonnes of methane (a greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere each year, which is being accelerated by rainforest deforestation to make way for more grazing land.\n\n\n**Ethical**\n\n\nI actually don't have a problem with subsistence hunting. I'd much rather people hunted their meat than went to the supermarket, though I recognize how impractical this would be at scale with 6 billion humans on the planet.\u00a0\n\n\nFactory farming causes a huge amount of animal suffering, there is really no silver lining or any way to sugar coat it. Some operations are better than others and there are some farmers that treat their animals well (as has been shown on reddit frequently), however these tend to be the exception to the lowest bidder norm, especially outside of North America where vegetarian/vegan initiatives or \"free range\" or \"organic\" movements haven't taken root yet. Here in Korea and other parts of Asia, there aren't even any animal rights laws (absolutely zero--someone could murder a stray animal and nothing would come of it).\n\n\nAll one needs to do is spend a few hours on YouTube looking at footage obtained from factory farming operations to appreciate the true impact that it is having. That's without getting into the inherent dangers of factory farms as breeding grounds for super viruses with the potential to kill a lot of people through meat consumption.\u00a0\n\n\n**Alternatives Exist**\u00a0\n\n\nI agree that a lot of vegan soy-based meat products suck. I always chuckle at the Ron Swanson bit on Parks &amp; Rec where he says \"please my I have another?\" to the clerk offering free vegan bacon samples then proceeds to dump them in the garbage immediately afterwards.\n\n\nThe thing is that the alternatives are becoming better and more affordable. Companies like Beyond Meat (funded by Bill Gates) are actually trying to recreate authentic tasting meat through a new process that has results that are apparently indistinguishable from the real thing (especially chicken). In the long term, \"in vitro\" meat will reach a state where it does an excellent job of recreating the taste/texture of meat (eventually including fat), is scalable and ideally cheaper. The most important factors here are cost and taste: consumers will gladly eat fake chicken instead of real chicken if the fake chicken costs less and tastes better.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\n**TL;DR** To conclude, I still don't understand why this is such a controversial opinion, particularly on reddit and among my millenial peers. I'm not arguing that we should all become full on vegetarians/vegans here; I'm arguing that the entire world needs to cut back on meat consumption drastically for the above reasons. I'd really like to hear a convincing argument for eating meat at the current rates we do because I honestly can't imagine what a convincing argument would be yet the majority of people still refuse to accept the reality of meat consumption.\u00a0"}
{"title": "CMV:\"Freedom of speech only applies to the government\" paints an ugly picture about how we value free speech.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ce657", "selftext": "Legally and Constitutionally the statement \"freedom of speech only applies to the government curtailing your words\" is 100% accurate.  This much I will not dispute.\n\nHowever, I've long held the opinion that this kind of statement takes too literally, and perhaps too much demands that \"freedom of speech\" can only be viewed as a legal object of American culture, and rarely anything more.  I believe there is a moral undertone of what it means to have this freedom, and if we create barricades and parameters for how we define that freedom, it becomes that much easier to take it away wholesale.\n\nNow here is where I feel I have to offer a caveat:\n\nMy dissent to this statement should not be taken to mean I think people should just deal with hate speech, \"fire\" in a crowded theater or bigoted ideas.  I think absolutely if you feel it is necessary to call out toxic attitudes, bad behavior or discordant themes that have a disparate impact on groups and individuals-it absolutely should be called out.\n\nFurthermore, if someone makes statements or aligns themselves with viewpoints that challenges their responsibility to remain impartial in positions of power, influence or prominence then it is in the best interest of the individuals they preside over and the group they represent to let an individual capable of thinking before they speak (for a lack of a better phrase here) stand in their place.  \n\nThat, however should not give individuals or groups carte blanche permission to engage in mobocracy to the point of going after the speaker's (for example, doesn't have to be verbalized 'speech') employer or livelihood, or even in some college campuses, crowding out individuals who come to attend a lecture about a topic and demand that person be stripped of the opportunity to earn a living, or collect a speaking fee from an institution that invited them to speak.  I believe once an individual or group goes from challenging disagreeable rhetoric to actionable attitudes such as calling for someone to be fired from their job (again in the absence of the questionable individual making statements that damages their ability to function at that job) or be disallowed to speak in public, we're crossing into dangerous territories.\n\n\n\nReddit, please CMV here.\n\nThanks for reading.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I understand diminishing returns but why isn't the market glutted with recycled paper products? A quick trip to Walmart shows this isn't the case. See what you can get paid for waste paper and you'll get my drift.\n\n\n\"But, but, but... It takes more trees!\" IDGAF.

It's cheaper to grow trees and chop them down for paper than to recycle it.\n\n\nLook, we're not using ancient hardwoods from Alaska to make toilet paper. I've taken forestry and horticulture classes. I've visited lumber sites and paper mills. These people aren't dumb fucks. They're using the land very carefully, with an eye to the future.

I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference.\n\nLet me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared.\n\nHere are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them:\n\n* More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough.\n\n* Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100% sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them.\n\n* Added financial benefit / tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 50/50. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat.\n\n\nNow here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response:\n\n\n* Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over $10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me.\n\n\n* Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 50/50 chance of going through exactly what my late father did.\n\n\nI hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her.  I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage.\n\nPlease, try to change my view - and thank you.\n\nEdit 1:  Whoever you are, thank you for mass-downvoting all my responses.  I'm trying to have a civil discourse, and if I'm frustrating you I don't mean anything negative by it.\n\nEdit 2:  Thank you all for your insight.  I have awarded one delta on this topic but for the most part I have not been convinced that marriage is for me.  Consider this CMV closed, although I may check back later to respond to any trailing opinions.\n\nI appreciate your time, and thank you very much.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Sword Art Online is one of the best Anime of All Time [SPOILERS]", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3cayqx", "selftext": "I've recently subscribed to r/anime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked [#459 on MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online), this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points.\n\nI believe this is due primarily to *hater votes*. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time.\n\nIn fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please!\n\nSome Background\n\n---\n\nI am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it.\n\n\n---\n\n**Why The Show Is Good**\n\nCharacters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there.\n\nPlot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. \n\nSAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is *very* story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments.\n\nIn the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players.\n\nAt the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world.\n\n**Writing:** SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and *excellently paced.* This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.\n\n**Art:** The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only *fantasy world* anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk.\n\nThe only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime.  For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand?\n\n**Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls:** Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics.\n\n---\n\n**Arguments Against**\n\n&gt; Overpowered Main Character\n\nThe story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a \"best\" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him.\n\nMeanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says \"become overpowered against things you can't beat.\" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop.\n\n&gt; Dumb Plot Moments\n\nIn the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action.\n\nIn the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character -- who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes?\n\n&gt; You didn't like the ending\n\nThe ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled?\n\nWithout that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward.\n\nPlus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel.\n\nI'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The issues are numerous but it seems like the catalyst for the blackout was the way they let go of Victoria without involving the reddit community or communicating with them, and seemingly having no plan of action on how to fill the gap in her responsibilities. \n\nI believe that perfectly acceptable reasons could have caused this course of action and to not accept that possibility and start a blackout and/or reddit exodus is irrational. \n\nFor example - a few years ago my company fired a VP quickly without having a real good plan on how to bridge the gap before we found a replacement. This individual had referred to another manager(semi-openly gay) as \"the faggot\" in a small meeting. We simply could not tolerate that behavior so we fired him the next day. It wasn't what was best for our bottom line, but it was best for the environment and culture that our company believes in. We didn't feel it was in the best interest of telling the whole company the reasoning for termination and several on that team were very upset by the clearly abrupt and unplanned separation - for several people their impression was \"management doesn't have their shit together\". \n\nI could imagine several scenarios where Victoria should be terminated quickly and it would not be appropriate to give a reason publicly. I would even say that reddit has been incredibly professional by continuing to remain silent on her termination even when facing the vastly damaging public backlash. "}

{"title": "CMV: You cannot object to a mosque being built unless you're also prepared to protest the building of any other place of worship. Anything else is discrimination.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3c8kaw", "selftext": "  This has become something of an issue in my home country of the UK where far-right groups have often targeted the building of mosques as a point of contention, even calling for bans. However I take issue with this. \n\n  Firstly, under the provisions of UK building law, anyone or any group is free to buy land, to submit planning permissions and to them build any building permitted by the provisions of the planning agreement on said land. Muslims are not and cannot be discriminated against in this regard. My local mosque was built by community donations, raising almost \u00a32m almost entirely of their own doing, before quite legally submitting a planning application, getting the plans approved and then building the mosque (using local builders and trades actually). This would be no different in my eyes to the building of a synagogue, church, gurdwara or any other place of worship. \n\n  Secondly, the actual dedicated building of a completely dedicated mosque building is more an exception than a rule, especially in smaller Muslim communities. Certainly for my own town, there exists probably only one actual brand-new mosque (the one I mention above). Others are in previously existing buildings. \n\n I am aware that there are issues to do with noise, people parking and blocking local streets/blocking resident access, but this is something which is typically taken into consideration at the planning permission stage. The way it works, there is usually a consultation period where civil planning experts consider issues such as these, and any person or group who feels the need to do so can raise an objection to the council for consideration. This goes for ANY building within a council's area, not just places of worship. \n\n   It must also be said that the noise and parking issues are also going to be an issue with any place of worship. I live in an area where the main church for that area is on a main residential road, and come any activity held at that church sees the main road itself, as well as a nearby tiny carpark, blocked with cars. I've also lived near a church which, come any major event, used to ring the bells and have large amounts of people there. The noise was very loud. \n\n  The only objection I can see seems to amount to a form of discrimination where simply because it is a mosque being built, people object. There seems to be no logical reason for their objections other than 'because Islam'. \n\nSo, can anyone CMV? \n\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: The result of the Supreme Court case on gay marriage is the next step in the \"sexual revolution\" and might have certain negative implication on society.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3c8jw2", "selftext": "First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I have never witnessed uncivilized discussion on here before and I'm glad to be a part of the community. Good job, Reddit!\n\nWith that said, if you are unfamiliar with the sexual revolution I am referring to, this is a time beginning in the 1960s where people experienced an \"urge to 'find oneself'\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution)). During this time, lots of previously taboo'd sexually related acts, ideals, etc entered into society and have more recently, at the end of the 20th century have thoroughly integrated themselves into it. This involves a large variety of things including but not limited to: proliferation and normalization of pornography, sex before marriage, acceptance of sexually explicit movie/television material, contraceptions, and the LGBT movement.\n\nFor example, pornography, which was formerly unheard of in public conversation is now often not only discussed, but glorified and upheld as a great thing. This is just one example of what I am talking about. *I am not arguing the moralities of pornography however.*\n\n**My argument: **The recent decision by the Supreme Court to rule in favor of gay marriage is simply the next step in the sexual revolution and essentially negates some of the arguments against the next step after this; I am specifically referring to  incestuous relationships, and other ways of \"loving\" someone. However, I will mainly refer to incest for the sake of a shorter discussion.\n\n* One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is \"unnatural\". One could also argue that incest is unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.\n\n* Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality. *For more information on incest please view this very informative [documentary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068473/).*\n\n* Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.\n\nWith gay marriage legalized officially, these arguments become unsubstantial and hypocritical to argue with against incest.\n\n**In conclusion, my fear is that the sexual revolution has the potential to continue to progress and eventually today's taboos will become everyday occurrences all on the basis of equality and non-discrimination.** This has the potential to effect humans on not only a genetic level by potentially allowing incest to corrupt human genetic material and cause genetic disorders, but also on a societal level where humans become more concerned with catering to someones sexual identity/preference rather than the actual person inside. I believe this could be devastating to humans. I don't claim to know what would happen, but it isn't too difficult to come up with a worst-case scenario of what society could become when the main focus of peoples interactions is politically correctness, being non-offensive, and catering to every form of person on a sexual basis.\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to clarify.\n\nCMV,\nTresky\n\n*Disclaimer: I am in no way attempting to say that gay marriage in and of itself is causing the downfall of humanity and am not attempting to demonize or put-down members of the LGBT community. I am merely making a case of a path that humanity could potentially be (and I now believe is) on that leads to a corrupt and evil society.*\n\nEDIT: Added information. Removed misleading/confusing information not strictly related to my argument.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Fossil fuels are also direct pollutants by way of ocean acidification and particulate matter.\n\nA carbon tax would encourage conservation of a limited resource, and discourage pollution. Just in case AGW is real, we would also have hedged our bets there.\n \nA wealth tax is equally virtuous because it discourages the pooling of money and encourages it to be pumped through the economy. It whittles away at inheritance and encourages investment (you need your investments to \"outrun\" the wealth tax).\n\nConversely, income, payroll, capital gains and sales taxes all act as brakes on the economy. All of them \"punish\" things we want people to do: make money, get paid, invest money and buy things.\n\nFor example, in the economy I describe, a small time musician would see virtually no taxes except those embedded in the fossil-fuel-based products that she buys. She would pay no income tax or sales tax. Once she went on tour and started using significant amounts of electricity on lights and sound, the event organizers would have to build those costs into the ticket prices. This means that the tour might be a bit smaller and a bit less coal might be burned.

For the purposes of the story and the limited resources available to the developers, saving the princess was the main goal. It made sense. But as time went on we get to see Nintendo princesses and women kick serious ass. Samus, Zelda (and Sheik!) and even Princess Peach when she's not getting kidnapped.\n\nWe see women characters in Nintendo games get treated as equals in games like Mario Kart, Mario Party/sports games and even Smash Bros. Princess Peach is one of the best characters in Sm4sh if you ask me. And while Nintendo has some progress to make (Super Princess Peach was an embarrassment), games like Super Mario 3D world (where Peach AND Rosalina are playable) show that they're willing to make the women the star of the show too.\n\nEven in the Zelda series, Princess Zelda isn't a character that just gets kidnapped. Twilight Princess shows us that she's the strong and powerful ruler of Hyrule. She was willing to stand up to Zant and Gannon, with a sword in her hand. Even in Ocarina of Time (spoilers ahead, lol) she is running around helping out Link as Sheik. In Wind Waker she's a kick-ass, take no prisoners kind of pirate.\n\nI know that the history of \"your princess is in another castle\" type stories are problematic but we've seen Nintendo's female characters grow and mature in a way that few other female video game characters have."}

I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things.

Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.  \nSo prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas!

There is an alternative to this called Base 12 would similarly go 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 X E with X=Ten and E=11 and then would roll over to 10=12, that really isn't terribly different to Base 12 but has some advantages. First fractions become simpler. Under Base 10 1, 2, and 5 are all multiples of 10, but under base 12 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are all multiples of 10. This makes dividing much easier than in Base 10. Secondly in Base 12 multiplication is much easier to remember. In base 10 the multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24; but in Base 12 the pattern is 4, 8, 10, 14, 18, 20. The ones place repeats  every three numbers in a regular patter unlike in base 10. Lastly we do use twelve as the base for a lot of things in are lives. For example a day has 24 hours, an hour has 60 minutes, and a minute has 60 seconds. All of those numbers are multiples of 12. If you don't use metric then you know that there are 12 inches in a foot.\n\n\n***Edit: I realize that the transition to Base 12 would be difficult, I knew that before I made this post, that is not what I want my view to be changed on, I want some one to convince me that Base 12 is worse than Base 10.***  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I am over 10 years out of college and have a great career. I have a hard time accepting that a driven, intelligent person would fail in finding success.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3c0rc5", "selftext": "This is not meant to be a troll post, but an earnest attempt to determine if my views are incorrect or unfair.  I have two minds when it comes to the fact that so many people have trouble finding a job that pays a living wage and is something they enjoy.  On one hand I am very sympathetic and feel that I have been lucky in life to get to where I am.  On the other hand I got to where I am through taking calculated risks and then stacking the deck in my favor.  There was definitely luck involved, but not all the risks I took paid out and I had to move on to something else.  I feel like too many people aren't taking matters into their own hands regarding their own success, like I feel I did, and I simultaneously feel proud and callous in that belief.  I am unsure which one is more correct.\n\nExample #1\n\nI have been on the recruiting side of multiple companies (tech sector) and have been blown away by the low quality/behavior of applicants.  These are the people that get through the resume filter and are invited on site.  Now I never test applicants on specific details of systems, because in practice you look those up as needed on the job.  I asked about what they have done in the past or what parts of their training they were most familiar with and tested their understanding of it.  I have had people that came into interviews and tried to act like they were running the show, people who refused to answer questions I asked, and people not familiar with the most basic parts of what they said they were experts in.  I know this is anecdotal, but the fact that it was so difficult to find people that were remotely qualified in fields they had spent years studying completely confused me.  The bar for applicants was not high in most cases my team was very motivated to find someone to hire.  I could not understand why people seemed to put in so little effort to sell themselves.\n \nExample #2\n\nI once worked for many years at a company that was funded off of venture capital around '08, where all investors closed up shop.  There was a lot of pressure on the company and there were multiple mass layoffs that cut staff to the bone and then even further.  I survived all of them, and eventually resigned because I correctly predicted the company would fold in a month.  I was fully aware of the risk of me losing my job and I countered that by simply being very useful.  This was a win-win scenario, because I was an enthusiastic employee and was happy to improve my skills through working on any existing part of the system or try to develop new ones.  Because of this I was more valuable than most of the other employees and had a ton of work/learning experiences I could talk about with recruiters.  Anyone on the team that was remotely difficult to deal with got cut, and I saw their downfall much earlier than it happened.  Now if everyone is being the star employee it would be a different but I have never found a group where that is the case.  For any individual on a team, you don't have to work more hours than someone else to be more valuable than them; you just need to be more friendly, cooperative, and effective.  In my experience that just requires effort and not any special creativity.\n\nExample #3\n\nI started off with a lot of bad habits that inhibited my professional development.  I am very stubborn, so I tend to go down the wrong path for quite a while before I accept that it is wrong.  Despite that, I always honestly evaluated why other people were more effective employees/professionals than me.  In those cases, I would take a step back, forget my ego, and ask myself what they were doing that I was not.  I'd talk to close friends about this to analyze my conclusions and when I figured out what they were doing better I would work incorporate that into myself.  It seemed much easier to mimic the habits of successful people rather than come up with the behaviors on my own.  The fact that I don't see a lot of people doing this completely baffles me.\n\nMy experience has been limited to the tech sector but I don't see why this wouldn't generalize to other fields.  Now there are certainly fields where the supply of people overtakes the demand, but I were in that position I would give it my best shot and if it didn't work out I'd move on to something else.  Please tell me if I'm wrong.\n\nedit: from a lot of the comments, I would like to clarify that I did not mean immediate success.  Rather, that one can be driven and follow a path that eventually does not pan out, but that being drive will eventually lead one to success.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think him getting some traction in the election is a great way to draw attention to those ideas.  But right now I feel I cannot truly support him for actually being elected president because of his age.\n\nBernie Sanders will be 75 when the next president of the USA is elected.  If elected, he would be 79 at the end of his first term, and if re-elected would be 83 at the end of his second term. The oldest president in US history was Ronald Reagan, elected at 69 years old.  And he ran into health trouble later in his presidency.\n\nThe man appears to be in good health now, but health can decline quite precipitously at that age.  A president dying is a trying thing for the country, but I think a president in ever-declining health would be worse. \n\nIn addition, POTUS is an incredibly demanding job.  I am quite skeptical that someone that age can really keep up with the rigors of such a job, even if they manage to stay in otherwise good health. \n\nI currently feel these concerns are strong enough that they outweigh any support I have for his views. Care to change my mind?\n\n(FWIW, I have some concerns about Hillary Clinton's age, too).\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Everyone has mostly accepted that it will be Clinton vs. some ill-fated Republican, and that Sanders stands no chance. \n\nI believe this is fully inaccurate, and anyone who believes this must have forgotten what age we are living in. This is the age of the internet, of instant communication, and of viral sensations. The amount of commercials a candidate is able to put themselves on does not determine their chance at winning. From what I've seen in just the past couple of months, Bernie Sanders has a very strong presence on the internet. He's old, but has the progressive ideals and values of most younger Americans. I think his name has been and will be spreading like wildfire over the next 16 months. And that's the other part people are forgetting...we still have a whopping 16 months till the election. That \"Alex from Target\" kid got popular in about a day for no reason whatsoever. Now think about someone who could potentially lead a nation - someone who many people are very passionate about supporting. Sanders will become just as much a household name as other prominent candidate.\n\n**TL;DR - Through the help of the internet and a shitload of time, Bernie Sanders has very good chance at winning this thing.**\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Religion is the only thing in the Universe that objectively compels us to live for something other than ourselves", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bxlje", "selftext": "*tl;dr* - **Nature dictates  that the strong survive and the weak perish. Those with power will do and those without power will not. Human beings are naturally selfish and self serving creatures even through our acts of love and kindness. Due to these 2 facts, there is nothing in this world that compels us to live for another human being other than the threats of punishments and promises of rewards religion brings.**\n\nI've broken my argument down into 4 parts and a final part to make it more digestible.\n\n**Part I: The Law of the Land**\n\nRight and wrong are man made concepts that apply only to humans. No other creature on earth follows rules of morality and ethics other than human beings. Nature dictates that the strong will survive and the weak will perish. Who tells a lion it is wrong to slaughter a gazelle for food when it can just as easily find plant life to eat? Imagine if cows and chickens could talk. Imagine one of them walking up to you and saying \"Human, I have feelings and emotions. You capture and breed my kind as livestock and reduced our existence to the mere purpose of providing you food. We have hopes and dreams and aspirations. We do not want to die\". You, like myself and like the lion would reply \"HAHAHA I eat you because I have the power to and you do not have the power to stop me. I have been equipped to exert my dominance over you and will do so because such is the law of the land\" and you would have every right to say so. If you have the power to do so, whatever it is, then it is in your right. Morals and ethics are immaterial, there are only absolutes (strength, speed, intelligence). This is the world we live in. \n\n**Part II &amp; III: The Nature of the Human Psyche &amp; The Mysteries of Love**\n\nI am not religious nor do I believe in a god but I am a visionary. I often thought of how to create a \"perfect\" society free of corruption and greed. No matter how much I contemplated on how such a society could be formed, I always arrived to the same conclusion: perfect societies are impossible because of human self interest. The most basic instinct in every living creature is survival. Every living creature on earth seeks to increase its own utility (content, happiness) through primary needs such as food, water and shelter but also through secondary needs such as entertainment, love, and companionship. Our entire existence is a goal to acquire those needs and serve our self interests. Greed will always exist because it is in our best self interest to be greedy. Corruption, cheating, stealing, lying - we do all of these things because they serve us. They work to achieve our desires and fulfill our self interests. \n\n\nRight now you're probably saying something like \"well then how do you explain the love we have for other people\". Understanding \"love\" is a mystery unto itself that I can't fully explain but I can say that for the most part, it still functions (for the most part) under self interest. The love we show our close family and friends is a result of having familiarity (and I would even go far as to say a sense of belonging/ownership) to them. MY son, MY daughter, MY mom, MY dad, MY friend, my my my....We typically don't develop love for other people until they have a stake in OUR lives. Whether you find them funny or charming or simply and inherent love that comes with coming from the same bloodline, we appreciate them for the joy they bring into our lives. Next you might say what about the compassion and kindness we show strangers less fortunate then ourselves such as the homeless people downtown or starving children in Africa. To that I ask you can anyone truly appreciate the pain of others without ever experiencing it or having the ability to sympathize with it first themselves (empathy)? Without familiarity to one's suffering on at least a basic level, I believe it is impossible to truly care for that person's well being. Think about it, when you give a homeless man $10 to buy lunch that day, you're doing it because you understand the pain of going hungry. Had you never experienced hunger or at least been able to empathize with his feeling of hunger, you almost certainly would not care for that individual's problems because you simply cannot relate to them. It is not until you can put yourself (literally, psychologically, or emotionally) into someone's situation that you feel compelled to make a change in that persons life. So I will repeat myself when I say everything we do is dictated by self interest, even the love and kindness we show others. I cannot think of one thing human beings are known to do that does not give us some kind of emotional, psychological or literal satisfaction.\n\nWhether they are from a different race, sex, religion, or culture, we fail to empathize with those who we view as different than ourselves and cannot place ourselves in their situation. Most genocides are typically predated by a period of propaganda used to besmirch the victimized group and dehumanize them from the people who commit the act. The German people didn't let the Nazi power commit their terrible acts because Germans are inherently evil, they did so because they were brainwashed not to identify with Jews as fellow human beings but as trash that needed to be exterminated. Everything we do is dictated by the self interest we hold in ourselves. \n\n**Part IV: An Inconvenient truth**\n\nAnd this brings us to the crux of my argument. When you live in a world where the only thing stopping you from doing as you please are your own capabilities and your main drive for living is serving your own self interests, what use is there to care for other living creatures? What compels us to help those less fortunate than ourselves other than the satisfaction we get from knowing we did something \"good\"? What is there in the world to compel us to live for someone other than oneself? You guessed it: religion. The only thing that objectively compels us to live for other human beings are the punishment and rewards religion brings. The only thing that truly compels humanity to care for others is knowing that if you don't, an infinitely more powerful being than yourself will punish you for it. There is no subjectivity here: either you do it and get rewarded or don't and pay. Even if you hate the person you are helping and cannot empathize with them whatsoever, you do it because it is in your own self interest. I have literally met people who have said they help others not because they want to necessarily but God wants them to. I will use Judaeo-Christianity as an example because it is the religion I am most familiar with. As awful as some of the messages in the Bible are, there are some good virtues in them as well such as helping those less fortunate and embracing your fellow man with love and kindness. The problem with this is most of us don't care about helping people we don't know and very very few of us would go out of our way to do so simply out of personal satisfaction. Without the threat and rewards religions bring, there is nothing compelling us to live for our fellow man.\n\n\n**Part Finale: Common Counter Arguments:**\n\n**But you even said yourself religion is motivated through self interest. Aren't there also scenarios where showing other human beings kindness serve our self interests and compel us to live for our fellow man?**\n\nNo. Showing kindess does not compel us to live for our fellow man because there is always the use of force. Remember the law of the land: Those with power will do and those without power will not. I cannot think of a single scenario where the use of kindness cannot be substituted for the use of force.\n\n**Religion does not compel us to do anything because you don't have to believe in a god**\n\nI'm not saying everyone has to believe in a god or that identifying with a religion automatically compels you to live for other people. I'm saying those who truly do believe in the existence of a heaven and hell and truly do hold the values of their religion are compelled and those who do not believe have nothing in this world to compel them to. \n\nMy rant is officially over. Now someone change my view. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: Zach Jesse should not have been banned for life from MtG tournaments by Wizards of the Coast", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bxfo6", "selftext": "So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of his past criminal history which includes a sexual assault guilty plea when he was 19. I'm not aware of the exact circumstances surrounding his offense. \n\nWhat unsettles me about the ban is that it seems to have occurred because another player, Drew Levin, pointed out Jesse's criminal past with a Twitter post: \"\"Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal.\" It should be noted that this is a very speculative and misleading statement, as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea.\n\nWizards of the Coast gave a short statement saying that the reasoning behind the ban was to ensure that players feel safe at events. Obviously a worthy endeavor, but I don't see how it really applies here. We are talking about large events at convention centers with thousands of people, security, etc. If, in the eyes of the law, he is not considered a threat to the public (i.e. not in jail) then how can Wizards see him as one?\n\nAnd what's the point in attempting to rehabilitate criminals if they are to be forever shunned from participating even in large public events? It's not like the guy is applying for a teaching job at an elementary school or something. They even banned him from online play.\n\nLastly, I do not think Wizards should have taken this action based on a Twitter witch-hunt that was started by another player. If they want to have a universal no criminal record policy at all of their events, then maybe it would be justified. But to selectively ban one person because he was villified on a social media site is pretty unreasonable, IMO.\n\nI want to hear people's thoughts on this because it seems like the r/magictcg community is vehemently opposed to the ban. I'd like to hear some outside opinion's. The SRS crowd seems to support the ban, calling r/magictcg a bunch of rape apologists, etc, but then again the SRS crowd is not very logical or reasonable. So I'd like to hear what you all think. CMV,\n\nEdit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta.\n\nEdit: So my view has been changed due to new information I have been made aware of regarding the details of Jesse's crime. Anally raping an unconscious girl over a toilet is pretty despicable, I had no idea his offense was even close to that magnitude. Thanks everyone who responded here. I can understand with why Wizards does not want someone who has done something so vulgar to be a top name in their tournament scene.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It seems to me that having more than two children would be irresponsible. 3 children and up equals more children than parents and therefore is contributing to population growth. 2 children and under, per couple, would lead to a slightly declining population, as not all children will choose to reproduce, either by choice, or some will not live long enough to make it to reproducing age.

{"title": "CMV: The USA should leave NATO", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3bwmk6", "selftext": "Note: my argument is not that NATO is bad as a whole, simply that it does not help the USA, the largest financier of the organization.\n\nNATO was important when the USSR existed. NATO enabled the USA to minimize the influence of communism in a war torn Europe that was still getting back on its feet after two world wars. It also provided allies to the USA vs. an equally matched superpower. However, although NATO today provides many benefits to Europe, these benefits are not reciprocated to the USA. The USA funds the majority of NATO, both in terms of the military costs and the costs to run the organization as a whole.\nsource: http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm\n\nToday, NATO acts as a funnel of money and resources to Europe from the USA with no clear benefits for the USA. Countries in Europe are easily able to afford adequate defenses for themselves, but they choose not to because they know that the USA will handle all their defense for them. Although this is good for Europe, it forces America to maintain high levels of spending for the military and European bases. If the USA pulled out of NATO tomorrow, Russia would not immediately take over all of Europe. Instead, European countries would simply increase their own military funding to an adequate level to defend themselves. With the GDP of the EU nearly equal to that of the US, there is no reason for the USA to continue funding them. The USA would then be able to eliminate many of the hundreds of costly bases it has in European countries, and not have to be worried about being pulled into wars that are thousands of miles away. \n\nEven aside from the economic costs to the US of NATO, there are likely some political costs as well. As long as the US is in NATO, the US essentially affirms its commitment to Europe over Asia. With world power increasingly moving away from Europe and to Asia, it does not make sense for the USA to tether itself to a declining Europe at the expense of improving relations with countries like India and China, who always feel they are playing second fiddle to Europe when dealing with a USA that is in NATO. \n\nEurope provides no real benefit to the USA in terms of military support, and yet the USA is expending enormous amount of resources to defend an already rich area of the world with no benefits to themselves. At the very least, the USA should refuse to protect NATO countries that spend less than the required 2% GDP for defense spending, which would allow the USA to decrease its military funding at least a little bit. Ultimately though, I think the USA should leave NATO. CMV. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

If the South were to break away, extremely few people would have the stomach for a fight that would result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of citizens.\n\nSecond, the South is motivated, and the North is not. If the South were to break away, it would be because the population has a great desire for their own independence. People in the north have no great motivation to keep the union together. I doubt that there would even be a fight.\n\nThird, if there was a fight, the outcome would be totally different than the first time. The South is in a much better position to defend itself than it was in the 1800's. The large population centers of the North would be more of a disadvantage than an advantage in a modern war. \n\nFourth, the only plausible way that the North could \"attack\" the South would be economically, but that could leave both countries in an economic ruin. There is just simply too much to lose to risk starting an economic war.\n\nSo, TL;DR.. The South would likely be able to secede without a fight. If there were to be a fight, they are much more motivated. The North would have too much to risk to try to stop them. "}

Their website claims that greed and other such behavior is learned and not inherent, so the idea that the Venus Project goes against human nature is false.  I say that the desire to have more than those around you is inherent, not just learned behavior.  The Venus Project seems to ignore the fact that some living areas are better than others, so simply because we cannot occupy the same space at the same time, inequality is created.  Why does John get to live on the beach and Fred is stuck in a desert?\n\nThe Venus Project, from what I've seen, also ignores the *how* aspect.  How do we convince leaders of different countries to give up their power and for the owners of resources to give up those resources?\n\nCapitalism, although flawed, is a better system and ideology.  Competition increases production and innovation, and it also generally decreases prices.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: \n\n&gt;I think one of the larger roadblocks I'm running into in is distinguishing between identity, behavior, and biology. Because of how closely linked they are I was willing to concede non-heterosexuality encompassing orientations pretty much from the beginning. However I'm also stubbornly holding on to the idea that historically, heterosexual behaviors have been encouraged and any orientation that would facilitate them would be selected for. From there, I concluded that heterosexuality and bisexuality would be the two most likely sexualities to be propagated (by some abstracted gene selection process) but didn't understand why the more restrictive option would be selected for over the less restrictive one.\n\nThe answer seems to be hiding in probabilities so if anyone can expand on that more I'm willing to give deltas. \n\nAlso, if you have a problem with my reasoning, please leave an explanation with your downvote so I can understand why it's off. \n\n---\n\nI struggle to believe that most human beings are naturally supposed to only be attracted to the opposite sex and are inherently repulsed by same sex characteristics. I think most people identify as straight out of convenience and having never needed to question what was assumed for them.

{"title": "CMV: Adult-adolescent sexual relations is illegal because we think it's icky, not because it's child abuse", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3btnba", "selftext": "Ok, I first posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/1qc9pw/the_real_reason_why_child_porn_is_illegal/) last year. My mistake was going to /r/philosophy hoping that no topic is off limits for so called lovers of wisdom. To my surprise even they can get quite boorish when they suspect that the person who posted has a pedo agenda behind him. For the record, I don't have one. I don't like appearing as if I am being defensive but I feel I have to say that because I have posted this opinion in the past and in my experience it is too provocative for most people to remain civil and rely only on the rational parts of their brains. BTW I have spoken about this with real life friends and professors - none of them have had any second thoughts about whether I am mentally ill or a child abuser or have been provoked to anger in any way - quite a contrast to the online forums. Anyway I am genuinely subordinate to the truth of the issue and my promise is that if I find any convincing arguments to the contrary I will change my mind. Hopefully this subreddit is full of people who are interested in discussion and not name-calling, witch-hunting, and all other sorts of abuse. If not, then I've lost all hope for the internet. \n\nFirst I'd like to make clear where I'm standing. I believe that amorous emotions that teenagers experience are very real and should be taken seriously. In other words, they are capable of genuine feelings of love and for the most part know what is in their best interest when they take part in a relationship. It's pretty clear also that we have almost no problem with them having sex with other teenagers their own age. Or if we do, then we aren't doing anything about it and have very relaxed attitude. Therefore, we believe that teenagers are capable of consenting to sexual activity to other teenagers. \n\nNow here is my main argument: If we do believe that teenagers can consent to have sex with each other, I believe that this means that they are able to give consent in general. It seems to me that it is inconsistent to believe that teenagers can consent to have sex with each other and not with adults because consent is something that is determined from within and is in no way dependent on the age of the other person. Therefore teenagers are actually capable of consenting to have sex with adults. \n\nThis is not a strawman at all. From the first comment of that post I linked by user slickwombat:  \n\n&gt; they are taken to be not capable of giving adequately informed and rational consent. \n\n\nAnother one from dogGirl666 found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bmka6/why_is_it_ok_to_let_my_daughter_fuck_some_14yo/csoi92k?context=3):\n&gt; a teenager is unable to think like an adult\n\nIf what slickwombat and dogGirl666 are saying is true, why let them have sex at all? Wouldn't that be potentially letting them fall into abuse out of their own doing? To me it is highly suspect to have a situation where we are extremely lax, or even encouraging, toward two 15 year olds having sex but as soon as that 15 year old has sex with a 20 year old, it is called child abuse. I'm not sure how this attitude came to be - it is possible that it arose out the moral panic from the 70s where children were being ritually abused in a day care center - before that there weren't even laws on child pornography. It was not even considered weird or perverse a hundred years ago for very older men to be engaged to girls who were still going through or just past puberty. So just as the new atheists come and try to flip the table on theists to prove their claim on the existence of god, who are we to say that before the 20th century, all societies were pathological where child abuse was rampant? I'm not saying that it is actually a good thing if it were the norm, for example, that girls were married at age 13, just that why the swing of the pendulum is justified at all. So in other words, I'm laying the burden of proof on you to to prove that all or a sufficiently high number of cases of adult-adolescent sexual interaction results in the adolescent being harmed. Or barring that, why the thesis - that allowing teenagers to consent to other teenagers but not to adults is inconsistent - is wrong. \n\nI know what the first reaction will be and although I admit to not having a good rebuttal to it, my answer is equally forceful as yours will be. First, let's be aware that teenagers naturally don't want to have sex with someone disproportionately out of their age group. They find it creepy, just like any normal human being would, and our laws of consent prohibit any unwanted interaction or even advances. Second, I believe that teenagers are for the most part and perhaps with the help of a little awareness and education, able to determine what is in their best interest when it comes to seeking a relationship. That doesn't mean that they are perfectly able to avoid negative experiences from it. That's the name of the game. Next, I would like to know from you that just allowing adult-adolescent sexual relations to happen, that there WILL be abuse. How do you know that teenage boys aren't already abusing other teenage girls if they are so impressionable at their age as most people would like to believe? How can you even adjudicate this when you define adult-adolescent sex ITSELF as abuse? \n\nThe last point I'd like to cover is supportive of my thesis. I mentioned this in my other post and I think it is a fairly strong point - and that is that our opinion toward young people is idealized and our attitude toward them is overly protective. Case in point: [groping a female is abuse only if she's underage](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-725352.html). My question is, why is age even being mentioned? Clearly the guy has an idea in his head that underage persons are naive, innocent, chaste or simply don't know what's going on and letting them have in on the fun would be doing them a disservice. Let's consider another case, not quite the same but related. Whenever something tragic happens to children, the news always capitalizes on them. Oklahoma bombing in 1995, more than 100 people died but news MUST mention that 19 of them were children. News of the Boston Marathon bombing, you can bet that the eight year old who died is always given a mention. [After Sandy Hook Piers Morgan got more riled up than usual and this is not the first time he's had a debate on guns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RC4JJWUtzkc). My point is that we give in to our emotions more when it comes to children for some reason. I believe this may be connected to our attitudes on adults-adolescent relations. \n\nThat pretty much concludes it. If you will answer, I would like to challenge you to make it clear on where you stand on the following questions: \n\n1) If you had an underage daughter, would you let her date an older man if you knew 100% that they would not have sex; \n2) On the topic of consent, would you agree that any girl who voluntarily takes a topless photo of herself and sends it over snapchat is abusing herself? \n3) continuing the above question, if no, then would you consider it abuse if she took that photo and handed it over to her boyfriend, who then would be guilty of possessing child pornography?\n4) Do you think it is possible for older men to genuinely fall in love with teenage girls? \n5) An older man has sex with an 18-year old. Turns out she lied about her age and she's really 16. Was the girl sexually abused? \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I have a pretty poor understanding of real world economics. I don't follow world events or watch the news.

This could include acknowledgment of a candidate's qualifications and positions, or the *actual content* of a particular bill. This has the added benefit of rendering wild claims and accusations made by the media, random bloggers, etc. less impactful on the views of the general public. *Note: Regarding this point, I don't want to discuss the specific content of such tests. As a rule, I believe it can be known what is true and what isn't, and so let's assume that the pre-vote tests won't contain personal opinions or interpretations of the subject.*\n\n* If voting is limited to only citizens deemed \"qualified\" by some form of the process described in the previous bullet point, the general outcome is more likely to be better (e.g. the people are more likely to choose a candidate they will still approve of a year later, and there will be less confusion regarding what is contained in proposed bills, etc.).\n\n* The \"right to vote\" should be a privilege that I am not entitled to if I'm not even going to take the time to research the subject.\n\nChange my view by convincing me that, as a 29 year old citizen of the United States of America, I deserve to be able to vote on important matters and issues without doing any research or showing that I understand what I'm voting for/against.\n\nEdit #1: Changed some phrasing.\n\nEdit #2: **IMPORTANT**: The difficulty associated with determining who is qualified to vote and who isn't seems to be the main issue here. I can accept that, and kind of figured this would be the case. I would like to simplify things by clarifying the overall view that I would be interested in changing.\n\nMy view is that, assuming we *could* somehow successfully identify qualified individuals for a given subject and restrict the polls to only these people, it would be advantageous to do so at the expense of the (Constitutional?) right to uninformed voting.\n\nIn general, I feel that it's justifiable to say that no American citizen should be allowed to cast a vote regarding a subject about which he/she doesn't have a clear and accurate understanding.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Having a soft currency is not an economic benefit for a country's citizens", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3brald", "selftext": "**Context:**\n\nGreece has been on international news lately, after defaulting on its IMF payments. A referendum is being held regarding the people's stance on a memorandum agreement next Sunday, and one of the topics of discussions is whether Greece would have been better off out of the Euro.\n\nAfter entering the Euro, Greek economy, fueled also from cheap loans, converted to mostly retail services, with the industry and agricultural sector faltering, after being overwhelmed by products that were cheaper and of better quality compared to Greek alternatives. As a result, industry and agriculture positions paid less well, further fuelling a drop in production.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that this was a currency issue, but rather an issue of internal lack of competitiveness. And in this sense, I believe that getting out of the Euro would not solve by itself directly any of the issues, apart maybe as a swim or sink method.\n\n**My position:**\n\nA soft currency as a means to increase competitiveness is useful only in populist societies, where the government can devalue its currency and effectively lower the income of its people across the board, thus hurting disproportionately those with the lowest incomes.\n\nAdditionally, a soft currency is inherently more open to market speculation and reduces trade, as more volatility implies higher risk of business.\n\nI have thought a bit on the subject and I sincerely would like to hear informed opinions on the subject, so naturally I defer to [Cunningham's Law](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham's_Law), to get the most balanced view possible."}
{"title": "CMV: Toilet paper is better than bidets.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bq7f3", "selftext": "I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.\n\n**Cleanliness**\n\nIn this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)\n\nSecondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.\n\n**\"But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!\"**\n\nNo, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nGood quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.)\n\n**Price**\n\nI understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money.\n\n**Eco friendliness**\n\nI think we're past the whole 'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up.\n\nTo clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical.\n\nEdit: The point here is that given a choice between a bidet and toilet paper, toilet paper is better. In situations where there's no other alternatives, of course one will be used over the other.\n\nSo, CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Copyright terms should be approximately 20 years.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3bpi3b", "selftext": "Copyrights are currently granted for insanely long timeframes.  Currently for the US it is 95 years, or for 70 years after the death of the author.\n\nThe original purpose of copyright is to give creators an incentive to create by giving them a temporary monopoly over their works before eventually giving those works to the public for the public's benefit.\n\nI think the term of copyright should be only long enough to incent creators to create and publish their works.  And I think very few works which are created today would not be created under a 20 year copyright term, whereas the public benefits to a shorter term are enormous.  A huge number of creators are prevented from creating derivative works without licensing incredibly old primary works.  And owners of popular old works are able to extract economic rents for simply owning something which has a statutory monopoly.\n\n20 years is the same term as currently applies to patents, and it seems to be plenty sufficient to incentivize new inventors.  There are no shortages of patent filings lately.  Which is great for me, cause I work in patent law.\n\nAs to the legality of such a change, there is no question that it would be lawful to do prospectively for new copyrights.  [This law review piece](http://harvardlawreview.org/2015/01/copyright-reform-and-the-takings-clause/) makes a good case that it might not be a 5th amendment taking requiring compensation to cut short copyright terms, though it came out before [*Horne v. Dept of Agriculture* strengthened per se takings](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-275_c0n2.pdf), and there is a plausible case that *Horne* could be used to argue that terminated copyrights are per se taken and subject to compensation.  So for the moment, I will limit this to a forward looking proposal for new works.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Its so short sighted and is as if the whole of society has just accepted the rat race created by the Federal reserve's mandate to create inflation and just seem to want additional check points along the way with cheese so they can keep running the maze. It would make more sense to me to just stop inflation so the poor (or everyone for that matter) stop getting taxed (which is what inflation is) every time the Fed prints a dollar. \n\nI know many people will say that deflation is bad because if prices come down then people won't spend while waiting for a better deal and we will just get stuck in a downward spiral of jobs getting lost while everyone waits to spend their money. I never understood that argument either because with all products from TV's to refrigerators to cars and even homes people buy them as soon as they can afford it because they want it now. TV's come down in price every year... doesn't stop people from buying one every couple of years to get the best tech that's on the market. Despite decent used cars being available people still buy new ones. there really is no logical basis for any prolonged collapse spiral due to people waiting for a better price on everything. That's just not how it works\n\nThe only real problem we have now is that rat maze that has been built over the last 100 or so years due to constant inflation of the money supply is that if we were to correct to the problem and shut down the maze the result would be temporary catastrophic as the deflation (or lack of cheese) that would occur that would bring us back to some sense of normalcy would be pretty painful. I know this is probably the biggest reason why no politician will touch this subject and why we need to be in the streets actually demanding it so we ca get rid of the systemic issue that is slowly (faster for some) driving us all into poverty.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think this is done somewhat out of vanity in that the psychological effects of worrying about looking different are caused by vanity but I don't think it is purely vain like many tattoos are.\n\nI think many people will point out that tattoos are often done in memoriam or dedication to a loved one. To me it seems that the love the person has is very real but the feeling that the their love needs to be expressed in their physical appearance ultimately stems from insecurity or vanity.\n\nWith that said most tattoos seem to be an attempt to make the person distinguish themselves with their appearance or as an act of rebellion as teenagers. Additionally in the last 10 years there has been the emergence of the ironic or absurdist tattoo. These are tattoos that are random or meant to be funny. Again this seems like a situation where the person feels a need to let people instantly know they are goofy or funny. \n\nThe reason I am posting this is because I feel that there is a stigma against cosmetic surgery that is not there for tattoos while there should be one.

The latter is divided currently between Cartels associated with either the Sinaola Federation, the Tierra Caliente, or the Tamaulipas.  \n\nEven in Europe, where our modern definitions of the Nation-State were born, intrinsic faults with this structure are showing in the crisis of Greeks default today.

In Austrian Economics, one such version of these Market-States is known as the REA, or Rights Enforcement Agency, which could be a preferable theoretical alternative to the partly Theocratically driven Islamic State, if put into practice.   Such experimentation may be necessary if we wish for the future of civilization to remain stable.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It is a human right for someone to vote for their government, and is listed as such in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (I've forgotten which article). Just because someone makes some decisions, no matter how bad, doesn't take away their status as a living, breathing, human being and should not have their inalienable rights as people taken away. If this is a right that all humans have, taking the right away from them is denying them status as a human being, and a violation of their rights.\n\nI think this is further exacerbated by the fact that many felonies (or at least in the US, not sure how this applies in other nations), are not inherently... bad. Possession of a certain amount of marijuana (varying by state IIRC), heroin, or MDMA, for example is a felony. Someone who simply wanted to exercise their right to put a certain substance in their body could have their human right taken away and thus have no say in the governing bodies that decide what happens to them as a felon.\n\nedit (7.1 1:30 EST) hey guys, thanks for changing my view, i have no fucking idea what to believe anymore\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I believe that poor people have every ability to pull themselves out of poverty, but most don't due to a lack of motivation.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bnan1", "selftext": "**Firstly**, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate Pink Floyd).\n\n**Secondly**, for context, I come from a wealthy family and have had very little experience with people from the lower socioeconomic spectrum, which probably shapes my view of the wealth ladder and how one climbs from rung to rung.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**: I believe there are levels of poverty within the lower class and perhaps each level should be approached differently in this discussion. They are as follows:\n\n1. *Physically/Mentally Unable to Work*: For all intents and purposes, this category should not be considered in my argument. They physically can't produce value and have little-to-no means to change that situation.\n2. *Homeless/Welfare/Food Stamps*: Sometimes shit happens and people need help, but six months to a year should be enough time for anyone to get out of this category, yet many don't. I think [the 35% of Americans](http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/terence-p-jeffrey/354-percent-109631000-welfare) asking for handouts get so used to doing it that they forget how to be a valuable member to society and end up just sucking resources from the rest of the productive population which brings everybody down. \n3. *Crippling Debt*: I think people in this situation, regardless of their financial education, show a general lack of care to manage their money. It's not difficult to see if a degree will be worth the salary raise or if a loan will actually solve your current problems and their are more than enough resources online and in libraries to learn about proper finance skills in order to do so.\n4. *Below the poverty threshold*: This is the general catch-all for everyone else in the lower class. I think problems like a botched health care system, over-imprisonment for drug sentences, and a generally rigged system such as having to pay to cash checks, not being able to afford the bulk deals, or own a home are factors that plague the lower class and rigidize social mobility, but it does not take away their opportunity to pull themselves up.\n\nEvery person starts somewhere in life, some get college education paid for, some join the family business and some are born an orphan without a bank account in their name. There's no question that some situations are more difficult than others, but there is also no question that examples of social mobility exist in both directions: rich kids wasting away a fortune and migrant farm workers becoming well-paid astronauts. \n\nI believe that as long as everyone has the freedom to climb the socioeconomic ladder rung by rung, that the only difference is between those that take the opportunity and those that don't and the reason why many people remain in poverty is because they lack the motivation to take the necessary steps, be it because they don't have peers pushing them to do so or because they would prefer to work a minimum wage job instead of applying for better positions--I can't say.\n\nAlthough I was fortunate enough to start adulthood with no debt, I have had to work my ass off to get everything else I have and believe that anyone could be doing what I do and making as much money as I do regardless of their starting hand if they desire it.\n\nEDIT: Great points, everyone. I am starting to see how success takes a combination of hard work and luck, the latter of which is invisible to most who are provided more of it. So far, the most convincing points have been the ones that have illustrated the poverty condition, and not just reminding me how lucky I am. The one thing I can't get past is that even if it is insurmountably more difficult to escape poverty, the fact that it IS possible makes me wonder if the institutions put in place making it difficult to make and keep money were removed if motivation would in fact be the only thing holding them back. I will have to come back a little later and read more thoroughly as I am at work now. Thanks for taking the time to respond.\n\n**EDIT2: I awarded the delta to /u/caw81 way down at the bottom. His/her post was short, but provided a piece of evidence for the mental hardships of the impoverished. A belief is only as strong as its evidence in the logical mind and before his/her post I couldn't get the nagging argument of \"what if they just tried a little harder\" out of my head. I feel strange for ever feeling that way now. Thank you for all your thorough responses.**"}

{"title": "CMV: The YouTube comments aren't that much different than Reddits.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3bm7ew", "selftext": "On Reddit, people like to shit on YouTube comments and how horrible they are. I personally don't find them bad, same for Reddit, but the complaints and reasons for why YouTube's is bad can apply to Reddit as well. \n\nHere are some of the complaints: \n\nStupid/pointless comments. \n\nPeople arguing a lot\n\nShit, there is more, certainly more, but that's all I can think of right now because of a stupid brain fart. I don't know, reply with some other complaints. \n\nLooking at just those two, you can most definitely see that on Reddit. I mean, how many times have people bitched about \"pun threads\" how many people bitch about \"F\" comments and whatnot. As for arguing, oh boy do people argue a lot. Especially when feminism pops up. I can't say I'm not part of what others would consider \"the problem\", but oh well. So, those two complaints can be seen on Reddit and YouTube. \n\nThere are other things, too, like the Reddit hivemind. You know, disagree with the majority, get downvoted to hell, see those askreddit threads about unpopular opinions, or things people dislike, and when someone dislikes something popular (Though, in those threads they tend to not get downvoted) people reply with \"2edgy4me\" which from my experience, also get upvoted/don't have a lot of people shitting on the person. That kind of a thing. \n\nOn YouTube, it's pretty much the same. Disagree with the majority? As in, \"I didn't like this video because so and so\" and you'll get completely shit on. Constructive criticism or not. \n\nThere is an important difference, though. On Reddit, this \"hivemind\" is more...effective, because downvotes (Depending on what you set the hide thing to, which you can change if you didn't know...least I'm pretty sure you can.) make the comment hidden and it's buried at the bottom of the thread so that your opinion shall not be questioned or challenged at all. It's like a combo of a hivemind and an echo-chamber. \n\nOn YouTube, least I believe this is how it works, comments with lots of replies and likes are usually the first comments you see. A comment with a shit ton of comments can be above a post with lots of likes and just a few comments. This means that someone posting against the hivemind, and since people like to argue against people who appose their beliefs or what they like, it can result in a post saying \"This video is fucking awful because so and so\" being one of the first comments you see, somewhat getting rid of the hivemind and echo-chamber. It doesn't, but it looks like it does. \n\nSo, that's what I think.\n\nEdit: Oh, I should also add, if you want to change my view try to explain to me why one of those things cannot be applied to the other, or why one of those things is worse on YouTube than Reddit, and some things that are completely awful in the YouTube comments that Reddit doesn't have, or doesn't have a lot of."}
{"title": "CMV: The second amendment is not effective as protection against the government's tyranny", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3blt1q", "selftext": "I've seen many times the claim that guns help protect against the government getting out of hand. I don't find this argument persuasive for these reasons:\n\n**The threat isn't effective:**\n\n* For the argument to really work, guns must present an effective threat to the government, or at least to the politician introducing some sort of freedom restricting legislation. Just having the gun isn't enough, there must be a perception of that people are willing to use it.\n* Guns are a weapon of last resort. To take arms against the government means a near guarantee that you'll sacrifice your life for it. This means it only makes sense if what the government is doing is so awful that death is an acceptable risk.\n* To achieve success there needs to be a large amount of agreement that this is the right path. Until that, it'll simply be terrorism and opposed by the rest of the population.\n* In fact, the actions of the US government don't seem to be especially careful when compared to the actions of say, an European government where gun ownership is restricted. So the threat doesn't seem to be working.\n\n**There won't be a clear point at which to resort to weapons:**\n\n* One path a government may take is to slowly reduce freedoms, in such a way that no single reduction warrants a violent response.\n* The other path is to drastically reduce freedoms, at a time where the country seems to be under attack. The violent response will be prevented by patriotism.\n\n**The results will be counterproductive:**\n\n* By the speed with which things like the PATRIOT act and the TSA appeared it seems like there are laws and proposed organisms lying in wait for just the right incident. An attack against the government that doesn't have widespread public support will result in the swift reduction of freedoms, using the attack as the perfect excuse for it. And the public will support it.\n* The American public is deeply patriotic and any such attacks won't get a positive reception, even despite the people having a serious distrust and lack of faith in the government.\n\n**The willingness to fight will be neutralized:**\n\n* A government changing to a tyranny, unless it's completely stupid, will do so with an amount of care and will try to ensure its own success.\n* A slow introduction of surveillance and restrictions will be able to push back the willingness to fight and undermine any forming resistance. Already existing laws and mechanisms can be used to sabotage such efforts.\n* If a resistance is forming anyway, a government may make just enough concessions to avoid a revolution.\n\n**My conclusion:**\n\nGuns as a way of protecting against the government overstepping its bounds aren't effective until things really get out of hand. By that point, there isn't really any freedom left to protect. \n\nCMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I've seen a few videos on the internet of cops dancing at block parties or playing a short round of cards in a park but none have gone viral like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl972jf8cs4) of an NYPD officer dancing at the NYC LGBT pride parade this past weekend. The general consensus is polarized; some people like myself are perfectly fine, even happy, that some officers are finding enjoyment and positive interactions with civilians in their day-to-day work rather than hostility and aggression; others feel that this interaction was completely unprofessional and that the officer should be fired or at least punished.\n\nI believe that the officer shouldn't face any punishment for simply dancing with a civilian for less than 20 seconds at a parade with clearly no imminent threat or danger present. My logic behind this is that many officers won't be punished for using excessive force or even wrongfully killing someone, so why should an officer be punished for taking 20 seconds to dance with a friendly civilian at a parade. Even if we lived in a world where excessively violent officers were rightfully punished, I would still be angry if this cop were to be punished for dancing at a parade.\n_____\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While slavery is apparently not illegal on Tatooine, it is nevertheless immoral, and Qui-Gon seems to recognize this. \n\nI realize that gambling on the podrace was necessary, since it would be wrong to take Watto's (non-living) property by force, even if he was dead.

Being a slave sucks bantha balls. \n\nAnakin was the only one who needed to be freed - Yes, but Shmi shouldn't have to be a slave forever because she's not important enough to the story. \n\nQui-Gon couldn't free all the slaves - Yes, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't free the ones he can. \n\nAnakin needed to sever his emotional connections - Yes, but it seems like he would be more attached to his mother if she was still a slave billions of miles away than if she was living somewhere safe and comfortable. \n\nThe Force wouldn't work on Watto - Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, not being hurled around the room with the Force like a ragdoll. \n\nEDIT: /u/Makes_Poor_Decisions changed my mind. Anakin would most likely not have become a Jedi if he could have lived with his mother and been free.

Nobody can live their life to the word of the Bible.  At least nobody in Western culture in this day and age.  To live by the Bible to the letter would land whoever did in prison and on death row.\n\nSo, with the way that humanity has grown and laws have evolved, people must pick and choose what to follow verbatim and what to shrug off as no longer relevant or possible to follow.  With same-sex marriage (something that is not even mentioned anywhere in the bible), people tend to take a few phrases from the Old Testament and interpret them to say that we should not allow gay people to be able to marry each other.\n\nNow, it is of my opinion that in fighting against gay marriage, unless you're also fighting for every other thing in the Bible that nobody adheres to, you are a hypocrite.  Not only that, but you've chosen a part of the Bible that keeps others from a basic civil right.  If your concern is about the sanctity of marriage, why is there no outcry about the divorce rate or how many people remarry without stoning their previous wife (who they must have divorced because she was unfaithful)?\n\nI see no other possibility than these people dislike gay people for personal reasons, be it that they think it's icky or it just makes them uncomfortable, etc. and have found a means to combat it.  To me, this is exploitation.  Exploitation of the religion they claim to love in order to make their lives a little bit better for themselves.  I do not know if this is considered a sin or not, but as everyone who is against SSM seems to assume that is a sin, I would have to assume that this is as well..... and in all likelihood a greater one.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If everyone stopped tipping, then restaurant owners would have to stop being greedy, or hire qualified people who deserve tips, and pay them as qualified people deserve.\n\nEdit:  to clarify though, I usually do tip, but out of social obligation.

God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  \n  \nI'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  \n  \nIt's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  \n  \nThese people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.\n\n***EDIT:***   \n  \nI had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  \n  \nThe argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.\n  \nMy favorite arguments were those along the lines of \"It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent.\" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming \"IM BEING OPPRESSED\" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.

I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   \n  \nI don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. **But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby.** These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. **People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.**  \n  \nOne PM I got said:  \n  \n&gt;I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  \n  \nHe doesn't take the time to think, \"How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?\" No, this person doesn't give a shit.

Well guess what: the number of billionaires in the United States is 536. We are #1 in the world in number of billionaires.\n\nBill Gates, at the top, has $79.3 billion USD. There's 2/641.\n\nWarren Buffet, $72.3 billion USD. There's 3/641.\n\nCarlos Sim, $72.9 billion USD. There's 4/641.\n\nLarry Ellison, $50.8 billion USD. There's 5/641.\n\nJeff Bezos, $39.5 billion. 5.5/641.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, $34.8 billion USD. There's 6/641.\n\nYou see where I'm going with this? Throw in a couple hundred more billionaires, the fraction starts filling out. Just what percentage are we, the people? About nothing, it seems.\n\nThe total sum of all billionaire holdings in 2008 was $4.4 trillion. Only seven years later, it's $7.05 trillion. It's approaching double in less than a decade. Number of US billionaires in 2008: 470 (est.). Number in 2015: 536. This isn't a rising tide - it's just the same handful of people siphoning up the world's wealth.\n\nNow I'll repeat that he measured net worth of the United States was $54.2 trillion in 2009. 1/5200th, per my belief for a wealth cap, would leave all of these listed US Citizens still billionaires - with exactly one billion each to their names. That would shrink their personal holdings to something less than 300/5200, which is a far more reasonable percentage (minimal) than the insane amounts they have now. They'd also live like kings for the rest of their lives, still, and so would their descendants - basically indefinitely.\n\nI don't really have any specific care how they enforce this wealth cap, just that they do. I do know that the US can basically enforce this on the rest of the world, given how they basically assaulted Kim Dotcom in another country and seized his wealth - the US has more military might than all of the other countries combined, and about 7 billion people would support such an action. So it's definitely possible.\n\nThe negative consequences of so much wealth in so few hands are obvious - we're all dealing with the fallout in a collapsing country based on greed and exploitation.\n\nBut I am open to the idea that a wealth cap might have negative repercussions.

{"title": "CMV: Bill Nye is not a real scientist in any meaningful way to the public.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bf41n", "selftext": "I submit that Nye's public perception of 'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one 'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script.\n\nEven working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. \n\nI feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted 'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. \n\nFurther, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in *engineering* from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.\n\nAnd to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do(did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. \n\nSo? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists.\n\nEdit: [Delta awarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bf41n/cmv_bill_nye_is_not_a_real_scientist_in_any/cslnyww), albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, [but we all know...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)\n\nTo many of the comments: \n\n- Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard.  \n\n- There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie 'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. \n\n- I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. \n\n- Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day. I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye. "}
{"title": "CMV: Most governments are untrustworthy.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ben4y", "selftext": "I have a feeling that I am not the only one with this view, but I will elaborate more on what I mean by untrustworthy anyway.\n\nOk, so what I mean by untrustworthy is that world governments are constantly lying to us and they are therefore undeserving of our trust. A good example of this are the promises that politicians make and break all the time. I use politicians as an example is because, in my mind at least, they are the representation of the government, so their triumphs and mistakes are the triumphs and mistakes of the government.\n\nI will use the famous example of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, where the British and American people were told that the reason we were going to war was due to the possession of weapons of mass destruction by Sadam Hussein. However, it was later uncovered that there was no intelligence supporting these claims at the time nor were there any WMDs when we arrived. Yet to this day, even though it is universally agreed that it was a lie in order to disguise their true motive, no government figure has apologised to us or, to my knowledge, the Iraqi people. In fact, I do not think I have heard any of them admit it was a lie either.\n\nTherefore, since I do not trust those who unapologetically and unremorsefully lie to me, I do not trust the government. I also have some Brazilian friends who share a similar distrust for their government, in light of the corruption allegations against Dilma Rousseff and other members of the government (I mention them to highlight the point that my distrust extends across most other governments of the world, not just the USA and the UK).\n\nHowever, believe me when I say that I would love to live in a world where I could trust those in power, really I would. It just seems that there is no desire to be forgiven or to make amends for the harm they cause. Imagine how much more productive I could be if I was not constantly doubting every piece of information I get from the government.\n\nPlease convince me that the government deserves my trust and, if that is not possible, at least convince me there are more than just a handful of trustworthy governments out there. I will not be convinced if someone tells me of one government that is trustworthy, I need evidence that such trust could be extended to, for example, the government of the United Kingdom as well.\n\nFirst EDIT (28/06/15): Hello and thanks to everyone who has presented their opinion, there have been some extremely interesting points. I thought I should make an edit to inform those who have used presented some examples that have been specific to the USA that I am in fact not American, so I am afraid many of the examples are lost on me. I was born in Wales in the UK, and, while I have some knowledge of how the US government operates, I am most certainly not familiar with the more intricate facets. Should you be familiar with some examples from the UK, then that would be most helpful. I should also add that I am currently living in Germany and it is approximately 22:15 at the time of writing this and I have work in the morning. So if I suddenly disappear it is simply because I have gone to bed, but fear not, I will return tomorrow.\n\nSecond EDIT (29/06/15): Good morning/afternoon/evening, I have been reading through some of your replies today, thanks again! Unfortunately, I have not found any views that have changed my mind, in fact I would say that I have become further entrenched in my view. As I initially mentioned in my post, I really would like to believe that governments are trustworthy entities, but I am yet to be convinced.

I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural.  If after death we experience what we experienced before birth which is nothingness, then isnt life meaningless?  Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering?  I personally believe life is meaningless.  When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living?  \nThe only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you.  But if you do experience nothingness after life then why should it matter when you wont be able to conceive of this suffering.\nIts been something I've been thinking a lot about lately... Change my view, please.\nAlso, this is not a cry for help and I will not be jumping off the golden gate bridge any time soon."}

The troika (EU, ECB and IMF) have done everything they can to prove that their goal is to defend capital over people. They have continued to punish the Greek people, even in ways that hurt themselves, in defense of banking interests. Greek bonds were mostly held by French and German banks and that debt was transferred from the banks to the European governments in a deal that was very much in favor of the banks. this entire Grexit situation is a repeat of the American bailout, banks win, people lose.\n\nThe destructive austerity they are forcing on the Greeks is criminal. and they are doing it just to prove a point (Wolfgang Schaeuble has been practically cursing out the Greeks at every turn for months).\n\nThe venom with which they attack the Greek attempt to let the people decide their own future is a blunt expression for their contempt for democracy. This contempt for democracy was also the evident when the French rejected the EU in a referendum, and were forced to eat it anyway.\n\nThis article by Perry Anderson is the best I've ever seen describing the nature of the EU (yes, a bit old):\nhttp://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n18/perry-anderson/depicting-europe\n\nanyway, this is a dangerous topic because it is so big. So I'm obviously trying to focus on the Greek situation and the banking case. But I'm open to other issues. change my view by proving that the EU is more than an imperialist project to defend the neoliberal financial order.\n\nEDIT: Im just adding this to rub it in, but it's disgusting the way they are letting people drown in the med. and how they just support any idiotic american military adventure. \n\nEDIT II: People keep saying that Greece got themselves into this mess, and they deserve the consequences. well, you're wrong. Greece got themselves into the mess with the help of European banks, who continued to buy Greek bonds, even when they knew they were being floated on a false basis. as a result, they did not properly assess their business risk and deserve to suffer the consequences at least as much as the Greek people do. Where do you think the Greek debt came from? the sky? So why are the Greek people the only ones asked to suffer? why not hold the European banks at least as responsible as they are holding the Greeks? I don't think i need to repeat the obvious answer.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: Lack of motivation is the main reason why people remain fat. Losing weight is not just simple, it's easy and cheap too.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3bcwok", "selftext": "I posted this a while ago but I was told by a mod to try again in a few weeks since it happened during but whole fattening thing. Here is an edited version of what I posted. \n\nSo far I've been careful to say \"simple\" instead of \"easy\" when it comes to losing weight implying that the steps are simple but the execution is hard. I used to do that because I never had to lose weight. I had to gain weight for a while but never had to lose it.\nNow that I'm on a cut I realize that it's not just simple, it's actually easy. Forcing yourself to eat is hard. Just go over to /r/gainit and see for yourself. I've been making myself eat more for almost a year now, while eating more got easier, it was still a struggle and it was expensive (buying lots of food is expensive). There's only so much you can shove in your mouth before you call it quits. Eating less on the other hand? Easy and cheap as hell. See a cookie I want? \"No, I need to eat fewer than X calories and eating this cookie means I have to eat less later which will make me hungry\". That's all it takes. As for expense, it costs less because you have to eat less. One or two meals a day that are each half of what I used to eat. Instead of burger and fries get either burger or fries. Instead of chips as a snack? Pickles. Everything is cheaper. Most days my food costs don't exceed $10, tops. Often it's a lot less.\nIn conclusion, if you want to lose weight you can easily do it and it costs less than it costs to maintain your current weight. The only reason people give in to the temptation is because they lack the motivation to say no.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: The solution to the human race's problems is to get rid of the human race.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bcczz", "selftext": "While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems.\n\nI believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence. Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis. In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people. Tonsillitis would be the possibility of people doing bad things and removing the DNA would be what we do to get rid of humans. I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet.\n\nOf course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars. I am sure that within 50 years, a group could easily genetically engineer a strain of virus to get the job done. Mass production of asbestos and coordinated release all over the world could work too. What I'm saying is that it's pretty easy and could be done quickly. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nNow, this is all assuming a few things:\n\n- That if humanity continues, we will eventually cease to exist against our will.\n- That humanity will never have true equality.\n- That war will always continue in some form.\n- That we will continue polluting/degrading the Earth as long as we exist.\n\nIf each human somehow became the \"God\" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right. Of course, that is all BS/fiction and we live just like all the animals on the Earth, aside from being special in our own little ways. I don't think we as a whole can ever fully agree on anything, and that our disagreements will always cause us problems.\n\nOnce again, I believe the destruction of the entire human population to be our best solution.\n\nAs an aside, some other animal may eventually evolve to be intelligent in the manner we are, so the possibility of simply destroying all life to forever end suffering of any kind on this planet is considered.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the legalisation of polygamous marriage", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bc4if", "selftext": "In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 argument that it\u2019s legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I\u2019m not interested in arguing whether or not this *will* happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse\u2019s other spouse, although you could choose to do this.\n\nWhile I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? \n\nIt's natural for humans to live in groups. 'Tribes' or 'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment.\n\nTo be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them.\n\nPeople sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone. \n\nA big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn\u2019t this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you\u2019re married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document.\n\nI\u2019m not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person\u2019s ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don\u2019t think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m against other people having the option.\n\nI'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don\u2019t want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason.\n\nSo please try to CMV! I\u2019m going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really p***ed off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them. If there are a lot of responses it may take a while though so please be patient! But in saying that if you reply purely because I\u2019ve committed to responding; if you put forth a low-effort comment you will get a low-effort answer.\n\nEdit: I'm getting a bit tired so off to bed for me before anyone else comments &amp; I feel obliged to stay up and discuss this some more! I will definitely be back so please keep the discussion going! \n\nEdit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them. It may take me a while as I unfortunately have other things that I need to be doing, such is life, so I will get to you eventually!\n\nEdit3: I have finally awarded a delta! Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down &amp; find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here: \n\"While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships &amp; the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.\"\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: there is no legal or moral argument against allowing incestuous marriage that hasn't been thrown away in pursuit of gay marriage.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3bbxyv", "selftext": "To start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**\n\nHowever, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.\n\nSo with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV\n\nEdit 1: Added emphasis.\n\nEdit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT)\n\nEdit 3:\nDeltas awarded to:\n/u/SquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. /u/the-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation. \n\nI don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Sanders and his supporters are the ones who don't understand socialism.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3bb5mn", "selftext": "I make this CMV in response to the claim I see on reddit by Sanders supporters which basically states: \"Most Americans don't understand what socialism actually is.\" My argument is that Americans absolutely understand the meaning of the word and its Sanders and his supporters who either don't understand it, or are trying to change its meaning as it is currently accepted in the USA.\n\nFrom the dictionary: Socialism is a social and economic system characterized by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system. This is socialism in the traditional sense and what I believe most Americans think of when they hear the word. Now I understand that socialism is a broad term and can encompass many different ideas, however the core idea of the term is the same: Government control of the means of production. \n\nThe argument now becomes that just like we don't have a fully capitalist economic model, Sanders does not want a fully socialist economic model. To me this means that instead of having a capitalist system where the goal is to have as little government intervention as possible (within reason), Sanders and his supporters want a socialist system where the goal is to have as much government intervention as possible (again within reason). This is how I, and many other Americans view socialism. So while Sanders may not at any time be pushing for some sort socialist revolution, he is still pushing for a massive increase in government regulation of industry. \n\nThe problem I have with Sanders and his supporters is that this isn't socialism to them. They see seemingly every government service we provide is a form of socialism and that being against socialism also means being against firemen and public school teachers. This is nonsense. As I've stated above we don't have a fully capitalist society today and there are social services that we expect the government to provide and pay for through taxation. However, these services are something we've come to expect from the government and most Americans have never considered their existence a form of \"socialism\" before the Sanders crowd came along and claimed that they are. It seems like they are trying to change the definition of the word as it has been accepted by Americans for decades, if not longer.\n\nTo summarize, I believe that simply being for more government provided services such as universal healthcare does not make you a socialist.  I (and I'd argue most Americans) believe that being a socialist means that in your ideal state you would like to have the government in control most of if all means of production. I therefore state that Bernie Sanders is wrong when he claims that just because he wants higher taxes and more government spending that he is a socialist. I also state that the way most Americans view the word is closer to its actual meaning.\n\nCMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Sadaam was a true representation of evil. All of his evils need not be explained one by one, but I think it's universally held he was evil and poison to the country he was ruling.\n\n\n\n As far as WMD, bush had conflicting reports as to whether they were there or not. Even if the reports leaned in the favor he did not presently own, there was evidence he had been trying to obtain WMD. Should we wait till he had obtained such to invade where he would surely use his obtained WMD in war? He also has the history of using WMD in war. He also stated in his trial, he did give the illusion to having WMD because he was worried if he didn't and it was known Iran would invade. He also I believe in 1998, not sure this exact year, refused to cooperate with having people come into the country to examine if he had WMD or not something he agreed to do in the early 90's.\n\n\n\nHe was also giving diplomatic immunity to terrorist and war criminals.

The war on terror was not just about bin laden but to all terrorist organizations. \n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, He wAs a terrible person to be in power, giving the illusion he had WMD by his own admission and history of being willing to use such, and aiding terrorist and war criminals. This was a good thing to strip him of his power. With that said we made many mistakes after the invasion. As far as setting up the governing body, dissolving the iraq army,etc. but as far as the decision to invade it was the right thing to do, and it lessened the places terror could operate in that part of the world. Also showing USA would not tolerate these many threats, not one or two, as other leaders have done,  but the many violations sadaam has committed will not be tolerated.

Regardless of that, Panda bears are dumb and lazy. We have to resort to artificial insemination because they are so fat they can't have sex. The females are only fertile for like a month in a whole year.\n\nI say let natural selection do its job. We can spend the money we've spent on Pandas on more worthwhile causes because the preservation of this beautiful 'bear' is a money sink.\n\nEdit: Thanks very much for your responses, I have been educated and updated.

If I were to win a big jackpot, it wouldn't be as a result of continuously betting, since that's not very interesting to me. I'm pretty risk-averse. As a poker player, one of the hardest things for me to do is bluff because I would rather fold than potentially lose more trying to bluff someone off a pot. If I won, I wouldn't invest the money into more gambling.\n\n- I would set well-defined, well-communicated levels of support for my friends and family. I would tell everyone ahead of time exactly what proportion I would be giving to them, and would stipulate that the bulk of it had to be spent on expenses which I cleared ahead of time (houses, cars, education, debt). Moreover, I would communicate to them that the reason for this is specifically because family and friends expecting money ruins relationships and ends up being a huge drain. And then after having that conversation, I would stick with that plan. I love my family, but I've always been very good about sticking to my guns when it comes to something I strongly believe. \n\n- I would hire a financial advisor at a reputable firm who works based on flat rates. No shady advice, nobody trying to profit on my largesse. \n\n- I would allocate some small percentage of the winnings to my own entertainment and benefit (perhaps 5-10% depending on the prize amount) and then invest the rest in a diversified portfolio and live off the interest. \n\n- I don't have a lot of desire for luxury items. I don't want to live in a mansion, though I would be a nice house (or two!) in a cool location, paying cash and using the interest payments to pay the property taxes and upkeep. I don't really want or need nice cars (just not interested). I enjoy travel, but there's no reason to blow it all on five star accommodations - I'm fine with merely \"nice\" things and not extravagant. And I don't really care about the expectations of being nouveau riche either. I'm happy with my current life and know that I wouldn't suddenly be much happier if I bought a bunch more stuff. \n\nObviously nobody knows exactly how they would react to ANY situation, but I feel like being intentional and reasonable at the outset can save a lot of the headaches that come with sudden wealth. \n\nSo you may not know ME personally, but you know these ideas and plans.

{"title": "CMV: In light of the recent Supreme Court ruling, the most logical extension of this policy is the eventual legalization of Polygamy and other non-standard marriage arrangements, which will have a negative effect on society as a whole due to the difficulty of defining \"marriage\" or a \"family\".", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3b7rjo", "selftext": "To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to apply to everyone in society. I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.\n\nThe reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that \"love is love\" and \"loving who you choose is your right\". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.\n\nNow I won't delve into the typical response of \"Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!\" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what \"marriage\" is.\n\nI believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of \"love is love\" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of \"marriage\" to include anything we want it to under the law.\n\n~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this \"relationship\"~~.\n\nBut then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.\n\nEdit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future. I ask this because all through this debate, most advocates for gay marriage rights said that comparisons of the movement to polygamy were ridiculous.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Thanks to everyone who contributed! Whenever it's appropriate and the rules allow I'm going to try this one again and see what comes. Cheers!**\n\nIn this CMV, for the sake of time and simplicity, I'm pulling primarily from this report release on May 5th of this year, though numerous other sources exist and I'm happy to see any reports that may contradict it. http://www.uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/Who%20Pays%20for%20Roads%20vUS.pdf\n\nMy specific view that is subject to change is that\n\n**all road vehicles should be subject to license and registration fees, the amounts of which are determined based on the impact the vehicle has on the road surface**\n\nIn other words, all road users should have to pay an amount corresponding to the amount of damage they cause roads. One general rule of thumb that could be used to calculate this (pulled from the above .pdf) is: \"the damage a vehicle imposes on a road surface increases to the fourth power of axle weight\u2014that is, a vehicle that weighs ten times as much per axle imposes ten thousand times as much roadway damage as a lighter vehicle.\" Building this formula into the cost of vehicle registration fees seems to me to be completely rational and should be implemented. In some cases iterations of it are already in place (toll roads, delivery trucks, etc.) It should be expanded to all road use.\n\nThis formula, however, only takes into account vehicle *weight*, and not vehicle *usage*, which is a more complicated fee structure, but one I believe should be taken into account as well. Additional fee structures should be explored which take into account miles driven, pollutant emissions, congestion fees, etc. \n\nAll this considered, I have no problem with requiring bicycles to be licensed and registered so long as the process is rational and efficient for the owner and the fee structure based on a fair consideration of impact across the board.\n\nFeel free to CMV!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Obesity is caused by potassium deficient food.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3b6u08", "selftext": "I proposed it here to show how implausble the high-carb theory is, but it actually seems to look less and less crazy the more I look into it and I would like to know if there are any obvious flaws that I've missed.\n\nIt fits the epidemiology much better than anything else. People start getting fat soon after they start eating food grown by modern agriculture, no matter what kind of food it is.\n\nIt's easy to save on potassium, since it only affects quality, not quantity of crops, unless the deficiency reaches extreme levels. Even when it does, the symptoms are easily mistaken for drought or pest damage. Large quantities of K are held in the soil, so it may take decades until the symptoms show and it's more profitable in the short term to not fertilize with K or at least add less than is being removed. K fertilizers were reportedly piling up during the recent economic recession, since nobody was buying them.\n\nPotassium and sodium salts were only distingushed by modern chemistry, so presumably table salt often also contained potassium in premodern times. (this is further evidenced by some ancient sources recommending adding salt to fertilizer for better tasting fruit, but KCl is used for that purpose, while NaCl is harmful to plants)\n\nIn America, the depletion probably already started early during the industrial revolution, when the importance for soil fertility was not understood and the ash from cleared fields was collected for potash and exported to Europe.\n\nPotassium rich foods were the first to be obviously affected. During the 20th century, vegetables became popularly known as something basically inedible, that you force yourself to eat because it's healthy, rather than something that is added to food for flavor, or even (carrots) as a sweetener.\n\nSupermarkets and fastfood chains further made it worse by caring only about cost and not quality. While the taste of low potassium food is different, it looks the same. It explains why fast food is associated with obesity, despite the food often not being inherently unhealthy. A piece of ground meat, vegetables, mustard and a bun is nothing unhealthy, it actually looks like a balanced diet. Other things like HFCS could also be associated with obesity only because they are commonly used to make low quality food palatable.\n\nIt explains why rich people are usually spared and why obesity is associated with low quality food, rather than any specific kind of food.\n\nIt explains why animals are affected.\n\nIt explains why switching diets helps some people, but with no observable pattern, except that the food is \"higher quality\".\n\nIt explains why most people seem to remember that food used to taste better, why western grown food is associated with poor quality in many so far less affected countries and why it's trivially easy to grow your own food that is literally incomparable in taste with most store bought food.\n\nThe fact that people strongly prefer potassium rich food itself suggests it's in some way important for us, otherwise there would be no reason to evolve the ability to taste the difference.\n\nRats too have been shown to be able to taste and seek potassium when deprived of it.\n\nThe symptoms of potassium deficiency also closely resemble many obesity related diseases - feeling weak and tired, depression, muscle pain, dysregulated blood sugar levels and pressure, heart problems...\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They could not understand at the time the weather, the sun, the cosmos, etc so it had to be God.

But I disagree that the universe, or multiverse, and all it's contents cannot be explained by science, and it's not logical to put god here. Change my views\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant.\n\nI have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail.  I've come to terms with the fact that every variety has low-quality sauce and not enough cheese.  What I can't stand, however, and definitely the most common flaw, is the terrible, *terrible* crust, which ends up either undercooked or bone dry, without fail.\n\nI understand that pizza can only be properly cooked using a pizza stone, but it completely baffles me that this is the best we can do without one in 2015."}
{"title": "CMV: I think that citizens that are not natural-born should be able to run for U.S presidency", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3b5ylx", "selftext": "The main argument I have heard for not letting foreign-born naturalized citizens from running for U.S presidency is the fact that that person may still harbor sentimental ties with that foreign country. As such, in matters concerning that country, that person may not put the U.S's best interest first. However, let me try to dispute that argument by using myself as an example.\n\nI was born in India and raised by Indian parents. When I was 3 my parents moved permanently to America but under current U.S law, no matter what I do, I can never run for U.S presidency. However, my brother can since he was born in the U.S 3 years after we moved here. Now both my brother and I have been raised by the exact same parents in the same household with the only difference being that he is 6 years younger than me and he was born in the U.S. For both of us, our first language was our native language (not english), we still live by Indian culture and tradition in our house, we have made equal visits to India to visit relatives, and we have equal ties to India. So why does it make sense that my brother has the potential to become the President of the United States and I have no chance at all when we both have an equal bias towards India.    \n\nHere's another example why I think it is ridiculous that foreign-born citizens cannot become president. Let's take the opposite of my situation. Suppose a person was born in America to Chinese parents but soon afterwards moved to China. He lives there for 30 years and then moves back to America. After 14 years of living in the U.S, he is capable of running for presidency if he so wishes. In this case, this person has lived the vast majority of his life in China, almost as if he was simply born there, and he is capable of being the President of United States. Despite the fact that I'm probably more suited to be president than him (from the fact that I was raised here, lived most of my life here, went to school here from kindergarten to college, etc) it is still impossible for me to run.   \n\nIn short, I'm saying that place of birth doesn't say much about your affiliations or familiarity of American culture. Instead of how it is currently, I believe that anyone who lives in the U.S, whether natural-born or not, should be able to run for presidency and the public gets to determine through voting if they actually become the President. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Probably also applies to US and part of Europe), but I just have to disagree with Ronaldo should be payed less.\n\nFirst of, the market sets soccer players salary, secondly, soccer makes trillions of dollars a year worldwide, it is only fair that players get a cut. Third, they are adding value to people lives. When you pay 50$ for a ticket, you are expecting to get 50$ or more worth of value off of that, or even more. Sportsman hence, generate a lot of fucking value.\n\nTo give you a different example, music. Taylor Swift sold god knows how many millions of copies of her new album. That means that millions of people willingly traded their 10 bucks, or whatever that album cost, for copies. Nobody was forced to buy it, judging by her fans reactions all parties are satisfied with the deal. She (and her team) created millions worth of value to her fans, only fair they make millions.\n\nAnd last, to those who say \"it's fucking easy, no one should make that much money by running after a ball / creating generic tracks\", it fucking isn't easy.\n\nEdit: teachers should be payed more, but not more than Ronaldo.\nEdit 2: When I said teachers could make more, I meant public teachers.

{"title": "CMV: I think agnosticism is the only religion (or lack thereof) that really makes sense", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3b5kly", "selftext": "I was raised Catholic but now firmly believe that agnosticism is the only religious view that makes sense given our limited knowledge of the universe.\n\nI generally dislike organized religion for creating an either-or-view of divinity. Either you accept my god or yours, my rules or your own. People are often raised to be a certain religion from a young age, so their religion is almost wholly contingent on their upbringing, location, etc. I think it is foolish to say \"my god is the correct god\" or \"my god is the only god\" when others just as vehemently believe their own god story. If anything, I can accept the more Unitarian philosophy that each religion's god story is pointing towards the same divine force. I am against the idea of a personified god, but I can understand the notion that there is some binding, transcendent force in the universe. I think one must abandon what John Rawls calls the arbitrariness of fortune (i.e. the societal and environmental preconditions that have shaped you) and try to consider religion more objectively. In doing so, I find it hard to choose one religion over another. As I said, I believe if there is a god, it is more of a force than a \"he\" or \"she\", and it exists at the intersection of religious thought rather than firmly in the confines of any one school.\n\nI also think it is foolish to be completely convinced that there is no god at all. The burden of proof may be on the people who believe there is a god, but it is equally impossible to deny the existence of one. If you view god more as a unifying force than a gray-bearded old man doling out punishments from on high, I think it is perfectly feasible that such a force may exist.\n\nSome view agnosticism as an admission of defeat. I think such a level of resignation is necessary. We simply cannot know if there is a god or godlike force at play in the universe. Though I generally reject organized religion, I think it is impossible to entirely rule out the possibility of a god figure, and I do not think this remains a possibility in my mind solely because I fear death or want there to be something more (i.e. my desire for survival). I just look at the universe and our limited knowledge of it and think maybe. Maybe there is something else. Maybe there is a transcendent reason why so much of our existence is so cyclical, why nature is so beautiful to us, etc. But maybe there isn't. We simply cannot know.

{"title": "CMV:Asking questions of a rape accuser to determine whether or not a \"rape victim\" actually exists is not the same as \"victim blaming\".", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3b56fk", "selftext": "In most cases of rape accusations, there is no witness to the alleged crime.  Accordingly, if the two parties to the alleged crime have opposing stories as to what events occurred, there is no on to corroborate either person's perception.  So the *only* way to determine which person's story is most likely to be accurate is to gather information from periods of time during which there *were* witnesses and compare those eye-witness accounts to the stories told by the parties to the alleged crime.\n\nSo if a girl says she was raped, and a guy says they had consensual sex, what types of information would be helpful from eyewitnesses?  Well, the actions and behaviors of the parties both before, and after, the alleged rape would be relevant, wouldn't they?\n\nWhile you can never know for certain whether the woman consented in the moment, any of her actions or behaviors that happened *before* the alleged rape that indicate \"interest\" in the guy or \"interest\" in sex would provide some indication as to whether or not the sex was consensual:\n\n* Was she hanging on the guy at a bar, or trying to avoid him?\n\n* Were they in a relationship that consisted of frequently going out to a bar and then having sex at his place?  Did they go out to a bar and then go back to his place in this instance?  Or was this a stranger that she met at the bar that night?\n\n* Was she making sexually suggestive comments to him earlier in the night, or was she rolling her eyes and his sexually suggestive comments?\n\nBy the same token, her actions and behaviors after the alleged rape can be indicative of whether or not the sex was consensual:\n\n* Did she leave his place in the middle of the night, or did she stay over, make breakfast for him and go out on a date with him again the next week?\n\n* Did she go to birthday party the next and a smile and laugh, or did she lock herself in her room for 2 days?\n\n* Did she call a rape crisis line the next day, or did she go out and buy a new car?\n\nNow let me be clear, just because you were hanging on a guy at a bar doesn't mean you consented to sex.  Just because you had sex with a guy previously, doesn't mean that you consented to sex this time.  Just because you make sexually suggestive comments to a guy, doesn't mean you consented to sex.  Just because you make a guy breakfast and go on more dates with him doesn't mean you consented to sex.  Just because you appear happy the next day doesn't mean you consented to sex.  And just because you fail to call a rape crisis center, it doesn't mean you consented to sex.\n\nBut there is no way, in most cases, to determine whether or not you actually did consent to sex or not.  And the answers to the types of questions enumerated above can provide support to indicate whether or not it was likely you consented.  And determine consent is the only way to determine whether or not a rape actually occurred.  And if there is no rape, then there can be no \"victim blaming\" by these questions because there is no \"victim\" to blame."}
{"title": "CMV: Although there are some differences between being transgender and transethnic, tansethnic people still deserve to have their identities respected.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3b4yop", "selftext": "At first, I laughed at Rachel Dolezal when I heard about the whole thing.  But given some more time, I realized that it was hypocritical for me to expect others to respect my identity while just dismissing others off-hand.\n\nI made a post on /r/ainbow asking people to be more respectful of other identities, but I just got a lot of downvotes and \"lol, ur retarded\" type comments, which is unfortunate, because I always thought of that as a place that was generally respectful of people.  Hopefully, we can have a more respectful and nuanced conversation here. \n\nThere are some differences between identifying as a gender and as an ethnicity (which I'll talk about later), but I think more important than that is the similarity.  Gender and ethnicity are both identities and roles that are assigned to us based on the circumstances of our birth.  They're thrusted upon us without our choice in the matter.  Society expects us to just live in the identity that was given to us at birth and punishes people who decide to adopt a different one.  This is wrong, because people should have the right to choose which role they want to live in.  People's lot in life shouldn't be given out by the circumstances of our birth, but rather how we wish to live.  And each person should have the freedom to identify as they wish and have that identity respected and not seen as a lie.\n\nThere are a couple of differences, that people bring up, but I think both of them are not substantive:\n\n*  **Being transethnic is \"not a thing.\"**  By which, I guess people mean that they don't really hear of many people who are transethnic, or society does not really accept transethnicity.  Both of these are poor reasons to dismiss someone's identity.  A persons identity is made valid, by them identifying with it, not by society accepting it.  And that's true no matter how small of a minority they are.\n\n*  **There's no proof that transethnic people have the same brain structure as the ethnicity they identify as.**  First of all, there's no proof, because proof hasn't been found yet.  It's not that there's been proof that transethnic people have different brains than the ethnicity they live as.  Second, even if there was proof, it wouldn't prove that transethnic identities are invalid.  It's not the structure of your brain, but how you feel that defines your identity, and the role you want to live life as.  And having desires doesn't go away just because there's no physical reason for them. \n\nChange my view.\n\n\nHere's what will change my view:\n\n   *  Showing me that there is a difference between transgender and transethnic people that is meaningful enough to deny rights to one that you give to the other.\n\nHere's what will not change my view:\n\n  *  Copy-pasting anti-trans rhetoric, but replacing gendered words with racial words.\n  * Downvotes (seriously, act like an adult)\n\nEDIT: By \"transethnic\", I mean people who are assigned one ethnic identity and role at birth, but wish to live with a different one. \n_____\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I would also argue that it way more harmful than Walmart/Ebay/Amazon banning the flags themselves. \n\nApple can ban whatever they want as a private entity.

I believe that when one considers whether or not to ban something, a symbol advocating an idea should be considered distinct from expression or documentation of that idea.  \n\nI believe that this banning is a bad business decision. Not only are they losing the money for the apps themselves but they are alienating a demographic that supports the flag, and a demographic that do not support the flag but support free speech. \n\nI believe this is bad for humanity because the backlash against this banning will turn the confederate flag into a symbol for free-speech, which will muddy up the issue of racial tension even more.

{"title": "CMV: Children who do not get 1st-3rd place DO NOT deserve a trophy for simply participating", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3b3s26", "selftext": "Hello CMV,\n\nI am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying \"hey, even if you dont try you still win\". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. \nWe all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding \nfailure/losing, CMV......\n\nEdit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to \"why\" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! \n\nEdit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! \n\nEdit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that \"all-star\" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub. "}

{"title": "CMV: Trying to turn left in a busy two-way street should be illegal", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3b2yc0", "selftext": "Where I live, there are quite a few two-lane streets (one lane going either way) that tend to get quite busy during the morning and afternoon rush hours. A trend I've noticed is that, on occasion, cars will stop in the middle of one of the lanes and put on their blinkers, indicating their desire to turn left onto a road that branches off the two-way street.\n\nWhat those cars don't seem to get is that the road is BUSY. These cars often spend many minutes sitting in the road, left blinker on, while watching a flood of cars zoom by in the other direction. In the meantime, they back up traffic behind them for MILES and piss off every single driver behind them. Only after multiple minutes, one car in the flood of traffic going the other direction will take pity on the hundred or so poor saps stuck behind this makeshift roadblock, slow to a halt, and allow the turning driver to pass through. \n\nNever once in my life have I seen the driver trying to turn left actually realize just how badly he's holding traffic up behind him and abandon his attempted left turn. It's always someone in the opposite lane who manages to find the shred of empathy to let him pass and release the flood of cars.\n\nBut enough about the rant - I'm of the opinion that this should be illegal, and deserves ticketing if caught (though, obviously, by forcing the car to drive forward and pull over in an area that won't block traffic further). An action like this disrupts the flow of traffic and ruins everyone's commute.\n\nSo, change my view!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia (it was never actually adopted by the C.S.A.)\n\nWhen I first heard of the \"Confederate Flag\" flying on the grounds of the S. Carolina Capitol, I was surprised how many people thought it was actually flying from the Capitol *building*, [when in fact it is flying from a 20 foot pole next to a 30 foot memorial to Confederate dead.](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/22/416548613/the-complicated-political-history-of-the-confederate-flag)\n\n\nI later heard of [Washington and Lee University in Lexington, VA removing the \"Confederate Flag\" from Lee Chapel in 2014.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/washington-and-lee-university-to-remove-confederate-flags-following-protests/2014/07/08/e219e580-06bb-11e4-8a6a-19355c7e870a_story.html) Lee Chapel is a chapel, museum, auditorium, and crypt where Robert E Lee's body is actually buried. I thought it odd that people would be offended enough to push for the battle flag of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia to be removed from the building that houses Lee's body and bears Lee's name, on the campus of a private university that also bears Lee's name but that they weren't offended enough to push for his body to be removed, or for the chapel or the school to be renamed.\n\nThis made me think that **if the argument for removing the \"Confederate flag\" from public view is that it has been so thoroughly tainted by slavery, the KKK, and the Dixiecrats that it cannot even be used in memoriam of Confederate dead, or even for the one general by whom the flag was actually flown, then we might as well just remove all government funding for Confederate memorials, physically move them off public and government ground, and even go so far as to purge places like Washington and Lee University of all \"Confederate taint.\"** \n\nThat to me seems like the logical conclusion and most honest position to take. I'm open to being convinced that Confederate memorials and statues should be permitted to remain on public ground, even government ground, and maintained with taxpayer funding and that private universities don't have to completely remove all evidence of Confederate influence. **I'm also willing for someone to CMV that people who push to remove the \"Confederate flag\" (but not the monuments, etc) do so because the flag is an easy target and they lack the conviction to push for a full purge....*not* because they actually have thoughtfully concluded that there is a substantive difference between the battle flag of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and the Confederate memorial it flys by.**\n\nAs a sidebar: I'd also be interested to see if anyone who thinks the \"Confederate Flag\" should come down believes that it is possible to design a memorial in such a way that treats the dead with respect without glorifying the cause. Something like a Vietnam War Memorial for the South? Or, **is it simply impossible to have a memorial for Confederate dead without being as insulting and divisive as flying the \"Confederate Flag\"?** I think that's an interesting discussion no one is having.\n\nEdit: Since the comparison to Nazi Germany is made so frequently, I thought I'd ask the good folks or at /r/Germany for some help. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/3b2ps7/does_germany_have_any_memorials_to_war_dead_of/) is a thread about how Germany handles their WWII war dead.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Free will cannot possibly exist in a universe in which there exists a god that is both omniscient and omnipotent.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3b1rxn", "selftext": "First off this assumes a Compatiblist view of free will. I believe that there is no \"natural\" free will. We are all chemical systems, and, as such, all decisions we make are really the inevitable result of the laws of physics. Even assuming quantum mechanics adds some amount of randomness, our actions are still the result of their nature, and not the other way around. Although this is the nature of the universe, I don't use it to inform my morality. It is just an observation of: What must happen will happen. To try and derive a morality from this would be fatalistic and essentially nihilistic in its practice. Since I don't think we know what will happen, in a lot of cases, that we can pursue what ought to happen and that that will make what must happen and what ought to happen become one in the same. And it is this ability to pursue that, with a mind that FEELS independent of nature that is the important thing. As long as we FEEL we can think independently of nature, we effectively can to it. And that's all that matters\n\n-\n\nThe other definition of free will, our ability to take actions independent of the intent of others, and independent of impulse, is alive, although not absolute. We are all hugely the product of the manipulations of other individuals. Our parents, our friends. We can deviate from them, but often we won't through pressure, apathy, or just our brain socially indoctrinating itself to fit in with its surroundings. But, to varying degrees, we each have free will, that is a will independent of the will of others. And some wills are more free than others, but all wills are at least a LITTLE free.\n\n-\n\nBut, if there did exist a god with omnipotence and omniscience, then I believe that it is logically impossible for free will of that second kind to exist in a universe in which that God exists. That second kind of free will can exist because of two things: 1: No will belongs to a conscious being with enough power, in either itself or the resources it controls, to completely control the will of others. 2: No will belongs to a conscious being with enough knowledge, in either itself of the resources it controls, to know how to completely control the will of others, or how its actions will effect the will of others. If either one of these conditions are met, then free will is severely compromised. And if both of these conditions are met then it is completely compromised. A God with omniscience will know EXACTLY how each of his actions is going to effect the universe upon which it acts. And if that God is also omnipotent, then he can cause anything he wishes to occur to occur exactly as he wants it. He would be able to and know exactly how to tailor the nature of any universe he creates or comes into contact with in such a way that the events he wants to unfold, must unfold exactly as he wants them to in that universe. He would not be oblivious to the consequences of any action he took, thus there could be no unintended consequences. Everything must therefore be intended by his will. But free will, as I said in the beginning of the second paragraph, is our ability to make actions that are independent of the intent of others. Therefore, free will cannot exist in a universe in which there exists a conscious will that is omniscient and omnipotent. OTHER than that of the god itself."}

But if you enjoy eating a good steak, then it is hypocritical to criticize others for eating what they consider is \"just meat\".\n\nAgain, I am stressing the fact that this is not about the *animal cruelty* part. It's just about the meat eating. For the sake of this CMV, let's suppose that the animals are bred and slaughtered in the most humane possible way.\n\nSo... CMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I know that personally, my paychecks are taxed between 25 and 30%, depending on overtime and the like, and it makes it feel so much more that instead of extra cash in my pocket, for going above the 40 hour work week standard, it's cash in the government's pocket.\n\nOf course, this might also be influenced by my somewhat libertarian leanings, in that I consider taxation in general an... unnecessary evil. It's a fact of life I'll admit, but I don't think that it should be. Ultimately though, this post is concerned with the justification of a variable tax rate, inasmuch as how there is a justification for the government to take a larger percentage of your money because you earn more."}

I understand that Reddit is a private business that can do what it wants and subreddit moderators are agents of Reddit and can do whatever Reddit grants them the authority to do.  This view is more of a \"that's the way things ought to be\".  Also, I'm not going to worry about setting a specific limit for what constitutes \"sufficient\" positive karma; at this point, I'm simply arguing that there should be some reasonable level.\n\nSubreddits are dedicated to specific topics and users can choose whether or not they want to participate in those topic discussions.  Positive comment karma is obtained by contributing to the conversation (theoretically) or contributing discussion points that people agree with (reality).  Subreddits *should* \"belong\" (not literally) to their users.  If the users of a subreddit appreciation the contributions that a particular user makes (which would be demonstrated with positive comment karma), a moderator shouldn't be able to trump or veto the opinions of thousands of other users simply because they personally don't appreciate the user's contributions.\n\n**Edit - View modified but not completely changed**:  I'd modify my view to say that sufficient negative comment karma in a specified window of time (hour/day/week) could open up the \"ban window\" and allow a moderator to ban a user who has completely changed their personality and gone from someone who consistently gets upvotes to one that consistently gets downvotes."}

Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in our universe before the Big Bang.\n\nNow of course this nothingness is incomprehensible and even typing this it boggles my mind, but science's explanation is that nothingness caused the Big Bang. Now there are several theories to this, such as somehow two universes rubbing or colliding together which sparked the event. I'm no scientist and I'm sure people will correct me (please do), but the point is we really don't know how the Big Bang formed from what we consider to be nothing.\n\nI tend to think, though, that some conscious entity had to be the catalyst that caused the event. It would seem that if there was nothing in our universe, some extra-dimensional being from another universe would have had to insert itself into ours, which sparked the event known as the Big Bang. I believe the being to be conscious because of the intentional way in which our universe seemed to form, and life sprung up. This begins to err on the side of intelligent design, but I do believe human beings, our consciousness, feelings, empathy, etc, have to be attributed to something higher.\n\nI believe that entity to be God.

{"title": "CMV: Reddit and our societies standards on religious/philosophical tolerance is inconsistant and hypocritical", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3avhws", "selftext": "Im probably going to ramble on and such so i will make my point clear from the way i see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice because its sort of half a rant too. I guess this is directed at a sort of liberal/progressive crowd, but can apply to right wing people too.\n\nEver since atheism and anti-theism movement sprung up on reddit we have been bashing it. Some of those reasons was correct. I believe atheists used too much rhetoric such as \"free thinker\", \"skeptic\", \"reason\" and \"logic\" to push their agenda. And we used to (USED TO) have neckbeards spewing some obnoxious shit. And i agree they come off as cringy. But in general, mockery of religion is fun, really fun and FAIR! We laugh at bullshit ideas all the time.\n\n\"im an atheist but please be tolerant, let them believe\" or \"People believe different things\" or something similar.\n\n-We have such an agenda of tolerating christians because in the west because the majority is still christian, this also influences \"tolerant atheists\" subconsciously\n\n-We tolerate Islam because \"that is the religion those people in them middle east believe in\" so it would make us racist to criticize it. Like i get it Fox news is racist, but i dont have to be racist because i critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people. Calling people racist for critizicing Islam is such a high level of mental gymnastics that i cant even. \n\n-We cant critizice Jews because that would make us literally Hitler. (I actually understand this one though)\n\n-Mormons are made fun of, but mostly they get the same treatment as christians \"let people believe what they believe\".\n\n-We dont respect the views of other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc.\n\nBecause?\n\nThey are not a majority, nor taught to us before we could write. That is what i think most people choose to ignore. We dont have people spewing tolerance of religion because we have some genuine need to spare someones feelings. Its because christianity is popular, based on faslehood and people feel like their beliefs are under attack.\n\nWhen was the last time you saw someone going out of their way to defend a person who claimed to be a wolf? Oh, wait they get laughed at and mocked universally. Guy claims to believe hes literally drinking the blood of christ? Someone mocks him and gets labeled a fedora neckbeard.\n\nLike seriously if someone tells you they believe in unicorns you can probably laugh in their face like \"HAHAHA, you believe that?\" and no one would bat an eye. However, have long debates where you try to go into detail of the problems surrounding religion and trying to debunk it? Richard Dawkins and speakers like him get called intolerant. As if a desire to uphold truth is somehow wrong because people get their little feelings hurt.\n\nThe way i see it religion is as fake as astrology or unicorns. But there is no one defending the latter. Religion is bullshit with good PR. I would prefer to keep laughing at people who think they are wolfs, but with a world where no one is trying to pretend like religion needs some sort of handicap from society to not \"hurt precious feelings\". I should be able to find religion absurd without being labeled \"Euphoric\" or \"fedora wearing neckbeard\". \n\nI wish we could call out bad ideas no matter how many people believed in it. I want eqaulity when it comes to mocking things. The way i see it now religion has some sort of taboo of criticism that is protecting it. The way i want our society to change its view is  for people to watch all three videos  below and laugh. Just for the sake of equality. Sincerely, i live in Norway so i recieve minimal damage from religion. I just wish religion did not have to have some protective shield and having it be taboo to criticize it because they will cry the loudest when mocked.\n\nPeople mocking stupid beliefs:\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtH7l-dhHZQ [1]\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlMiKrwCRQ0 [2]\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea6w3zp-dYY [3]\n\nPenn Jillette: Why Tolerance Is Condescending\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpNRw7snmGM [4]\n\nWhat would change my mind is either:\n\n-A huge amount of people going out of their way to prevent people from critizicing bullshit ideas such as Astrology, para-psychology etc. (people can believe what they want, tolerance, does not hurt you)\n\n-A huge appeal to mock christianity from its own communities.\n\n-Some source proving society not having a total hypocritical view of what bullshit ideas we are aloud to mock and not\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I see the coming timeline like this: (copied from a reply to another post)  \n\n&gt;2-5 years: The last major technological hurdles (driving in rural/poorly documented areas, driving in adverse conditions, cost) are resolved. Cars are now demonstratively better drivers than humans in all situations. (note: may be a very liberal estimate.)  \n4-6 years: The first round of legal cases involving driverless cars is settled, producing a precedent that makes driving your own car very risky. A collision between two vehicles, one self driving the other not, almost always results in fault to the driver. Causing an accident while operating a car with unused self-driving capability makes drivers extremely vulnerable to being sued.  \n5-10 years: Safety studies, overwhelmingly favorable to self-driving cars, lead to the option becoming mandatory on all new vehicles. insurance companies, burned by litigation, offer premium rates to those who never switch off the driverless option, while increasing rates on drivers who elect to operate their cars manually. Soon the difference between these rates becomes enormous.  \n10-15 years: Commercial driving is entirely automated. Cabs, buses, trucks, trains, \"driver\" becomes an obsolete profession. The savings in both wages and liability is simply too tremendous to allow any non-automated fleet to remain competitive.  \n15-20 years: Studies conclusively show that the only traffic casualties that still occur are exclusively due to human operator error. It becomes evident that driving your own car is unthinkably dangerous, like drunk driving at night with no headlights or seatbelts. Safety laws are passed that effectively outlaw operating your own vehicle.   \n  \nBy the time my nephew is 15-16, controlling a car will be something that only hobbyists do, and never on public roads.  Very few cars will be privately owned, rather they will be operated by private or municipal transportation services.    \nThe age of the personal automobile is ending.

Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. \n\nI can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. \n\nIf you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. \n\nAnd just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. \n\nAlso, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. \n\nSo, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: The Prestige, the machine does not work. Spoiler alert.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3askwy", "selftext": "I will start by I have struggled with this concept since it has been brought to my attention. I know this movie extremely well, better than I should, and have previously debated just about every scene. Not to say the this conclusion is right but to say I do know the film and the characters well. \n\n\n\nMy basic theory stems from, The movie constantly allures to what and how magic is done, which has nothing to do with 'real magic' but with deceit. That's what the machine is deceit.  Will give  a summary of my theory now, leaving out the beginning and end, and details as my post will be too long for any interest. I will elaborate on the beginning and end , and details once the discussion begins.\n\n\n\nSo Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no \"magic\". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs \"real magic\" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work. \n\n\n\nAngier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning.\n\n\n\nI will add a few of the questions about the machine working theory that I have, which can be answered by my theory. These questions could be preluded with \"if the machine works\"\n\n\n\nWhat is the tank Caine and Angier are pushing during the ending scene? If if the last clone is in the morgue, and the tank had been broken to extract the clone what tank are they pushing?\n\n\n\nWhy store the clones? What not rid of them every night?\n\n\nWhat is the air bubble at the end in the only visible tank.\n\n\n\nHow did Angier gain full control of both his legs while drowning? The movie goes through some length to show how damaged it is, why do this if it's not meant to be.a clue\n\n\n\nIf Borden sends angiers to tesla, it's his plan, why wait till he has  captured Fallon to give him Teslas name, why not give it to him when he gives Angier the diary?\n\n\n\nI have more of my theory to share, and more question to ask those who disagree it this is already too long. Looking for reasonable, logical, light hearted debate, so bring it on reddit change my views\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: I believe that Islam is an inherently violent religion that is incompatible with Western society and for moral and ethical reasons must be non-violently eradicated.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3as9vv", "selftext": "Hello /r/changemyview, I'm here today because I believe Islam is an inherently intolerant religion that not only condones violence against non believers but actually commands it. To this end I believe that Islam will never be able to fully reconcile with the West and that humans in general have a moral and ethical responsibility to eradicate it. Of course I do not condone violent means. Quite frankly I believe that if the US and other 1st world secular countries (such as in Europe) began to fund universities all over the Middle East that Islam would fall apart naturally, as its persistence throughout the world is predicated upon ignorance and the valuing of the Ummah above all else. That being out of the way, Id like to breakdown my indictment of Islam into three main points:\n\n1. The first is the Islamic theology of abrogation, which is the idea that God can contradict Himself and change reality from the rules He previously set; this is dangerous for many reasons - one can argue that the surah saying to respect other people is chronologically prior to God's commandment to destroy the infidels. \n\n2. I would say is the ummah (=nation), which is actually a departing from the Semitic thought of what a community was until that point (Syriac and Christian Arabs use the word for \"people\" instead). The very idea of the Ummah creates an unreconcilable \"us v. them\" mentality, inherently incompatible with multiculturalism or even coexistence. It also perpetuates ideas of petty tribalism and poverty (by denouncing the importance of education and societal advancement in benefit of reproduction and growing the Ummah). Which yields the last -\n\n3. Jihad is much more dangerous than people think, despite it being a buzz word. Jihad as-saif, or \"struggle of the sword\", is the idea that anyone in the common body of Islam is obliged to join in physical resistance against infidels anywhere they threaten Islam. This is basically the theological justification of the aggression of Al Qaeda, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, ISIS, etc. It's very dangerous because the Western mind compartmentalizes groups into nations - this transcends national boundaries because many Islamic fundamentalists deny states even legitimately exist. So for instance when Afghanistan was fighting against the USSR, there were muslims from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Morocco, etc. fighting for Islam in Afghanistan. Likewise, these same countries (even muslims from the US and Britain) have joined in fighting those they view as evil secular leaders, such as Bashar al-Assad.\n\nI know what most of you will respond, that I am a bigot who cannot see over the shortcomings of other Abrahamic faiths like Christianity and Judaism, and that just as many atrocities have been committed under those faiths. I would say to you that these acts were committed by representatives of the faith but not sanctioned by the faith. Christianity itself dos not sanction violence, but Islam does. Jesus taught to love your enemies, and Mohammed sought to destroy them. This leaves no room for interpretation and very specifically calls all Muslims to fight against enemies of the faith (read: Non-Muslims) wherever they may be.\n\nWith regard to my three points, people would argue that the first point is not an issue because Islam knows the proper order of the Surat, and that the only reason why God commanded Mohammed to kill everyone is because they were threatened and it is analogous to the Israelites being commanded to fight surrounding tribes. To this I would emphatically say \"Yea, right.\"\n\nTo my second point, they would say that nothing about the idea of the Ummah excludes non-Muslims, they're just not equal, but that's every religious society. They might even go so far as to say that the Ummah isn't even necessary for Islam, just Muslim dominant countries. I passionately disagree with this, and Islam CANNOT exist as a minority religion anywhere by its own nature. Wherever it exists it seeks to establish Sharia, and must be the ruling religion at least by its own mechanics. I don't have the source here but a recent survey stated for instance that 4 out of 10 Muslims in the UK seek to institute Sharia law. And there are already muslim arbitrated courthouses in the country. This desire to force sharia is not a product of extremism but rather an actual tennet of the faith, and that difference is crucial.\n\nLastly they would say that jihad as saif is only one type of jihad (the one normally portrayed in the media) and that only extremists would commit this act. To them I would say that they are bad Muslims because technically their prophet and hadith commands this form. M Surah 9:5, also known as the Verse of the Sword, proves this.\nWell that isn't a very strong argument just because Christianity doesn't inherently sanction use of violence, more so examples like the crusades were a specific historical incident (not to mention they killed other Christians, sacking Constantinople and killing many Greeks, Copts and Syriacs whereas at least Copts and Syriacs have lived centuries under the yoke of Islam with no theology of violent reaction).\n\nIslam is very much a material reality of political philosophy. No one is an Islamic theologian; the biggest names in Islam are Sharia interpreters. Islam's entire existence supervenes on the ruling of the Ummah, whereas Christianity can exist in Christian countries or in pagan countries.\n\nMany moderate and so called \"modern Muslims\" would no doubt be offended by what I'm saying, and assert that I am touching on only the extreme points of the faith and that most Muslims don't practice these things. To them I would say unapologetically, you are bad Muslims. Let me unpack that statement. I do not mean to say they are bad people, and in fact I find their modernism and willingness to compromise refreshing. However, they are \"bad\" Muslims in the sense that they are not following a path that their faith is explicitly calling them down. Most modern Muslims are humanists, and their faith is more of an inherited cultural identity than anything else.\n\nBack to extremism. There are many modern nations where Islam exists in the minority, such as the USA and Europe, and it is relatively tolerated. I do not know an example of a Islamic majority country where minority religions exist without a noticeable and tangible degree of persecution.\n\nSo reddit, CMV.\n"}

I think if a person has toiled in this country long enough, paid their taxes, haven't committed any heinous crimes, etc etc, they are entitled to be able to apply for citizenship and not have it take 10-20 years to achieve. \n\n\n\nI am, however, against the idea that literally anyone who can buy a plane ticket or boat ride to the states can pop out a baby, have it be a US citizen, and promptly return to their home country a week or two after the fact. How does a baby who spent all of what, a week?, on US soil have a higher right to citizenship than anyone else--especially when the process takes so long for honest working people who likely contributed much more to this country? \n\n\nNews sites claim that up to 60,000 Chinese nationals alone give birth in the US and promptly return back--there are even specialized birth hotels specifically for birth tourism. \n\n\n\nI feel that a person should be entitled to US citizenship only if they have actually contributed to the well-being of this country. Some foreign offspring who spent the blink of an eye here, whose parents have never ever paid US taxes or contributed in any way to this country, should not have automatic citizenship. \n\n\n\n\nIf an illegal immigrant gave birth and stayed in this country (which many do), that would be a whole separate issue entirely. But to separate birth tourism from cases like that, one could enforce laws regarding duration of days in the US to ensure citizenship. \n\n\n\nMy views are NOT against illegal immigrants, or people who have actually worked on this land and paid taxes and done something for this country. I am against people who squeeze out a baby and promptly return, doing NOTHING for the states except to take advantage of their child's citizenship later on. I bring this up because I'm teaching abroad in Asia, and a local friend mentioned how his friends are popping out offspring in the states. I find this incredibly immoral, and think it does nothing but hinder the citizenship process for people who have actually lived, worked, toiled, in the country and are American in every other way except citizenship.

{"title": "CMV: Taylor Swift is the wrong person to be criticizing Apple, and her stance on streaming services in general is wrong.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3as2oi", "selftext": "*(The following is a blog post I posted earlier today, but I wanted to get this forum's opinion as well.)*\n\nYesterday, Taylor Swift made headlines by releasing an open letter to Apple about its new streaming service, Apple Music, and the company\u2019s decision to give users a free three month trial period without compensating its artists. In an eternal testament to Swift\u2019s influence in the industry, Apple has already reversed its decision.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Swift has taken an issue with a streaming service. Back in November, she pulled her music from Spotify, insisting that the service wasn\u2019t compensating its artists well enough. At first glance, this seems a fairly worthy cause for Swift to take up arms about. I highly doubt many people would disagree with the notion that artists deserve to be compensated for their work.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Swift is being entirely honest in her intentions. To be clear, I\u2019m not defending Apple here. Even though it has the legal ability not to compensate its artists for those first three months, it\u2019s also more than capable of footing the bill. I have a strong suspicion that the quick reversal had more to do with the potential PR backlash than it did anything else. I think it was good that someone called Apple out on it; I just wonder if Swift was the right person to do it. Her crusade against Spotify (who was/is compensating its artists, just not enough for Swift) already makes it look less like a righteous protest against this specific policy from Apple Music, and more like she just hates streaming services cutting into her bottom line. This is especially true when she\u2019s pretty much the only major artist complaining.\n\nNot to mention the fact that despite the apparent comfort Swift has in speaking for all the struggling artists out there, she\u2019s probably less qualified than almost any other musician alive today. She moved to Nashville when she was 14 and spent two years working with some of the prolific and experienced songwriters in the world before releasing her debut album at the age of 16. That\u2019s a debut album which sold 40,000 copies in its first week, by the way. For someone speaking out in defense of new artists, the absurd advantages she\u2019s been given in the music world make her just about the least struggling artist imaginable. Swift quite simply doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to play a local music scene and hope she catches the eye of someone, or to sign on an indie label and hope a song sees some radio play. Swift, for all intents and purposes, was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. For her to act like she\u2019s the spokesperson for a group she\u2019s never been a part of and whose struggles she\u2019s never experienced\u2026 Well, it would be like a white woman becoming the head of an NAACP chapter.\n\nThat lack of experience as a struggling artist might help explain why she seems so ignorant to the idea of the need for exposure, as well. While the paycheck is certainly important, it\u2019s nothing without enough people hearing about you that they want to buy your music. Spotify and other services allow artists to get their name out there in a way that wasn\u2019t even possible 10 years ago. That doesn\u2019t give these services license to rip off artists, but many artists are simply happy to have the platform at all, regardless of the royalties being paid out. Given that she had the full PR hype machine of a major label behind her from day one, I\u2019d wager that exposure isn\u2019t really something she\u2019s ever had to worry about.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole argument about the nature of art and putting a price on it here, but that\u2019s an entire article on its own. More than anything else, what really bothers me about Swift\u2019s attitude is that she\u2019s completely ignoring the pretty large portion of the music-listening population who simply can\u2019t afford to go out and buy albums. Swift\u2019s fanbase is pretty heavily weighted towards adolescents, who are far less likely to be able to drop $9.99 on an album than say, the 23 year old college student with a job. For some, streaming from Spotify or Youtube is literally the only way they\u2019ll get to hear Swift\u2019s music (sans radio singles). In all of her protests against Spotify, she has completely and totally refused to acknowledge the kid with no job and no allowance who can\u2019t afford a copy of 1989.\n\nAnd really, it\u2019s all probably for naught anyway. Swift may have removed her music from Spotify, but piracy means there will always be a way to get her music for free, and with The Pirate Bay, she\u2019s not getting any royalties. I just hope she can afford some tissues to wipe her righteous tears with. $200 million isn\u2019t what it used to be.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: The gay rights movement only further serves to alienate gays and keeps them 'unequal'", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3arybt", "selftext": "I believe that all the gay pride and gay culture (e.g. taking the rainbow as a symbol of homosexuality like a nation's flag) only serves to further separate gays who, in my understanding, only want the equal rights they deserve. I don't attend straight pride events, or talk about how excited I am about being a heterosexual all the time.\n\nI fully understand the dynamic of being out helping the individual accept who they are and invite those who are afraid and in the closet to come out and embrace their true selves which have historically been shunned, thus leading to the obvious fear one has about coming out. I believe gays should be treated completely equally and allowed to marry, raise children, and work in society just like any other human being. Homosexuality is naturally occurring and gay bashing is inherently wrong and incredibly destructive towards gay individuals.\n\nHowever, the 'gay culture', which is objectively manufactured and not natural (e.g. the gay lisp some gays, including two I personally know, force themselves to have in order to fit the model set by gay culture) doesn't necessarily force, but definitely pushes these already disoriented people who, because of society's structure, do not know how to express themselves or act relative to their sexual identity. I think embracing who you are is what they should be doing, but embracing an artificial culture of flamboyancy in order to 'fit in', which I think is what they were trying to do before coming out in most cases, can't be much better objectively.\n\nI could be wrong, and a good enough argument against this view I hold has yet to be presented to me. So go for it, Reddit. CMV \n\n\n\n----------------\nEDIT\n-------------\nOk, so I got a lot of replies that I'm grateful to get. If there's any confusion, let me attempt to clarify.\n\nI think that the gay rights movement is fantastic, and I probably worded my question wrong. What I was referring to is the individually accepted cultural of 'butch' lesbianism, or hyper flamboyance as behaviors. When I say these are not natural behaviors I mean in regards to the INDIVIDUAL displaying them. I feel like many are just filling a role they think they're supposed to fill because they're homosexual. I'm sure they aren't consciously aware of it, but gay culture is inherently different from, say, Hispanic culture or Chinese culture. This is not an ethnicity and not a set of behaviors gained from birth. In my observation it is a learned set of behaviors that many (not all) gays believe they need to conform to as part of their sexual identity. \n\nI am not referring to being openly gay and having pride parades, which are objectively good for closeted individuals afraid to come out for fear of social rejection or worse. I am referring to loud, incredibly in-your-face individuals who seem to either be seeking attention or, as in the argument, behaving as they believe they should because they have observed it in other individuals. They are almost like religious zealots, who as a population tend to be alienated by most.\n\nMy argument is that through enacting this persona of extreme flamboyance and borderline annoying overstatement of making their sexual identity continuously known these specific gays are doing more harm than good in terms of advancing equality and social acceptance of homosexuals and are creating a bad public image for the LGBT movement.\n\nA comparable example would be blacks &amp; African-Americans who fill stereotypes of committing crimes and being civilly disobedient, rude and racist against whites solely because they fall into peer pressure or societal pressure to do so, feeling it is what they should do in their cultural sphere.\n\nI think these things are ridiculous and working against civil rights and undeniable social equality not only in legal terms but in the views of individual members of society as well as society as a whole."}
{"title": "CMV: I'm not Transphobic", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3arwer", "selftext": "Recently I have seen a lot of posts regarding the topic of transgender and transphobia. This post is based upon a statement that I have read over and over again. \"If you were attracted to someone, learned they were trans, and then lost sexual interest in them, then you're transphobic.\"\n[Example](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/395o5x/cmv_transgender_people_who_have_had_sex/cs0lp9c)\n(If pointing to someone else's comment isn't okay with the mods then let me know and I'll edit this out)\n\nMy argument revolves around the definition of Homophobia and comparing that to Transphobia.\nA quick google will result in having them both defined as... Homophobia / Transphobia is the irrational fear of, aversion to, intense dislike of ,or prejudice against gay or transsexual or transgender people\n\nI do not go out of my way to avoid gay people, I am perfectly fine with having a gay friend, and I don't look down on someone for being gay. By the above definition I am not homophobic. Assuming I follow all of the same rules, but for transgender or transsexual people, then I'm not transphobic.\n\nThe counter argument seems to be that if I am no longer attracted to someone after I learn that they are trans, then I am somehow discriminating or I have an aversion to them. But I would say that going by that definition I would also be homophobic.\n\nAs a straight male, I'm not attracted to other men. If we assume that I would enjoy anal with a woman, but not a man, then it could be said that I am discriminating against gay men or that I have an aversion to them. That's simply not true though. My body is programmed to want to be with a woman, so my sexual preference clearly isn't what determines if I'm homophobic. It's how I act around gay people that determines if I am homophobic.\n\n Just because I would avoid having sex with someone who is currently a man, and was previously a man turns me off, doesn't mean I have shaky morals. It simply means I have been programmed to be that way. Just because I don't like the taste of avocados doesn't mean I'm avophobic.\n\nIn the same sense, if I were to be turned off by learning that someone I would have had sex with a is currently a female, but formerly a man, it isn't due to me discriminating against them, its due to a biological mechanism trying to get me to have offspring. Again in this situation, my sexual preference is not a question of morals.\n\nIn conclusion since I am not homophobic and I act the same around gays and trans, then I am not Transphobic.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The Confederate Flag should be federally banned from any state or municipal building as well as any company drawing federal benefits", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3aqhn2", "selftext": "Note: This is going to be kinda long because I'm kinda angry and I think this is a good idea, but I'd like to understand the counter arguments. \n\nBackground: In the wake of the Charleston shooting many people on Reddit, and in the real world, have pointed out that we're poised to go through the same four step routine we've all become way too used to after events like this.\n\n1. Fight about gun control\n\n2. Discuss the amorphous \"mental health\" problem without any specifics\n\n3. Bicker about something other than the actual problem. For instance, religious persecution instead of racial prejudice.\n\n4. Get bored and forget about it.\n\nMany people have been outraged over the fact that despite such comically obvious evidence that this was a racially motivated act, we're not going to do anything about the growing race problem in the U.S...again. Even going so far as not lowering the Confederate Flag outside the South Carolina Capitol building because that flag inexplicably requires a 2/3rds vote to lower. That has in turn raised, or re-raised the issue of stubborn insistence on using antebellum symbols and homages all throughout the South, which many people have pointed out as indicative of the pervasive racial biases throughout the country. \n\nThe Idea: A federal law banning flying the Flag of the Confederation outside any public or municipal building, as well as a phasing out of all names associated with the Confederation from public roadways, buildings, etc. \n\nThe Rationale: There are so many reasons, but I'll try to keep it succinct and duck most of the moral policing. First, It is tremendously offensive to black citizens, which, is fairly self-explanatory, and frankly should be to white citizens as well. Setting aside the racial implications, which we shouldn't, the Confederate Flag is a symbol of treason. Not only that, we are the only developed nation that not only displays, but does so with pride, symbols of our darker past. South African government buildings do not fly the Rhodesian flag, nor do the Japanese fly the Imperial flag. Germans have damn near made the Nazi flag a punishable offense.  How can the U.S. maintain any sort of moral high ground when we're rubbing slavery in the faces of ~15% of Americans? \n\nOn the more implicit side, this is a very late, but very necessary, line in the sand against the more insidiously underground racial biases we still have. We're not going to tolerate this any more. The atmosphere that allowed Dylann Roof to foster and nurture his beliefs. No, not all beliefs are acceptable anymore, and you're going to have to stand out in the open if you hold these destructive beliefs. The government cannot continue a tacit tolerance of such a simple and easily solved FIRST step to mending race relations. It starts here, at the Flag, and we're actually going to stat working on our race issues.\n\nSo that's my stance. CMV\n\n"}

I also *assumed* that we all had the same best interests.  By and large I still think that, but it's not as clear cut.

Even if they were aware of the social impact, it would still be a worthwhile trade off.\n\n(2) /u/DaFranker  - While we might think that we are logical and think/act in our best interests, we often do not (akrasia).

It interrupts our day with unsolicited, unimportant offers.  It is generally a social burden.  \n\nHowever, I can't blame the telemarketing companies. They provide a service, follow the law and get a result for their client.  I can't blame the person working as a telemarketer.  Each person has to earn a living the best way that they can.  So long as it's a viable &amp; legal model, it's fair.  I also don't blame the legal system.  We have national do not call lists, but there is only so much that big government can do.  It is a general, public good to allow strangers to contact one another.  Without breaking that down, the loopholes abound for companies.\n\nBut I do despise anyone who is willing to pay any amount of money for a product or service sold by a telemarketer.  This single handedly propagates the cycle and causes everyone else the annoyance of having to deal with a telemarketer.  Even if the person were interested in the product, I think it would be better to hang up the phone and purchase it elsewhere.  \n\n**EDIT**: I should have mentioned\n\n(A) I am in the United States\n\n(B) I am already registered in the national do not call registry.\n\n\n_____\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: There is nothing wrong with the Confederate flag being flown near the South Carolinian state capitol.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3apo84", "selftext": "EDIT: The Swastika and the CSA are completely different historically. Yes they both have done some horrible things and I am not in any way claiming they are justified for doing them. BUT HISTORICALLY any movement away from an established institution (slavery was around in the US for 100 plus years) is going to cause a rift. The South was wrong and they lost (thankfully). The Nazis on the other hand brought genocide into their country and amplified ethnic/racial tensions, this wasn't a case of people resisting an institution that has been in place for a hundred plus year. One factions is a group of people resisting change for good causes, the other promoting change for bad causes. \n\nALSO.... looking at it from this perspective in no way condones slavery. I am simply giving a historical context for both situations. Just because it existed for 100 years prior to the civil war doesn't make it alright, it does however give you a frame of mind for some of these soldiers. Mix that with the fact they thought they were not being represented in the Federal Government, and yea they were a little ticked off. So please do not stoop so low as to call me a person who condones that...\n\n\nOriginal Post:\n\n\nI find it very annoying that in light of recent events this subject has gained traction. At the South Carolina capitol, a confederate flag flies and now that the shooting has happened, people are calling for it to be taken down. Not sure why people believe this is the cause of the shootings, the guy was a racist and a nut case. This flag flying had little to nothing to do with creating a culture of southern racism. \n\nTo set a few things straight:\n1. The flag cannot be taken down to half mast as it is a fixed flag (there is no string to pull it down, it simply sits on top of the poll.)\n2. The flag is attached to a Civil War Memorial, fitting in my opinion. It is not attached to the capitol, it is on the grounds of the capitol. \n\nBeyond this my argument is that the flag is a part of US history and specifically, Southern US history (and since South Carolina was the first to secede... it has a highly unique history there). Yes, the flag does hold some racist connotations because it was essentially hijacked by the KKK and Neo-Nazis. This does not change the fact that it was a battle flag that Americans fought over in one of the most devastating wars in US history. \n\nI understand there were confederate national flags and the one we see flown today is a battle flag. I still find it acceptable for those in the south to fly the flag as a reminder of Southern culture/pride and a memorial to those lost during the war. \n\nIf those who argue the flag represents those who wanted keep slavery I have two counter points. 1. The American flag represented those people for a much longer duration of time than the confederate flag, it is a dark part of our history and should never be forgotten. 2. It is estimated that 25%-33% of soldiers owned slaves, others fought because of vicious actions taken by the North and others to defend their homes (look up Sherman and Georgia).\n\nFurthermore lets not forget this war wasn't slave holders v.s. abolitionists. The war was certainly about slavery but it wasn't as black and white as some people suggest. The South was fighting to keep slavery as a state right separate from federal law, the North was fighting because they didn't want their country being split in half. \n\nLastly, flags are symbols that can be interpreted in multiple ways. There are those that see the American flag as a imperialistic, evil symbol. There are those that see the confederate flag as a stark reminder of our nation's dark history and cultural heritage. Just because a few people have championed it as their symbol for their hatred does not mean everyone who flies it agrees with this point of view. Furthermore, just because people find the flag offensive does not mean the flying of the flag was there to offend. \n\nTL;DR The flag flying in South Carolina has historic meaning and is attached to a memorial. It is not intended to offend or to represent racism. It is justified historically and by the first amendment to fly at the capitol. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Access to restrooms is a basic human right, and it is wrong for tax-funded spaces to charge money for them, if not all businesses.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ao3xl", "selftext": "I recently was in Europe, and all of their public transportation stations (bus and all of EU rail) made you pay 50c - 1\u20ac to access their restroom. I believe that access to a restroom is a basic human right because of its universality. All people use and need a restroom, regardless of gender, race, or income. They provide a healthy and private space compared to say, a bush or alley. I am not joking - for many people this is a choice they have to make. Public urination is a big problem in urban areas. Being forced to defecate in public is not just unsightly and unhealthy to others, but it also adds personal insult to the injury of homelessness. I saw several people loitering near these payable restrooms asking for 50c to use them, which I don't believe is something one should have to do. To restrict restrooms to those able to pay is morally wrong, and cannot be allowed, especially in places funded by taxpayers.\n\nThere are several benefits to opening up public restrooms. People use restrooms to clean themselves as well, so opening them up would increase overall cleanliness. Arrests for public urination would decrease, reducing police and jail costs as well as street cleaning costs. I don't know if respect for the homeless would *increase*, but I think disrespect would decrease as people stop sneering at those asking for money to use the restroom.\n\nSome may say that opening the restrooms to all would make them dirty. About half of these payable restrooms I saw had a person standing there to collect money, who could in the free case just be another janitor (they already have to clean them, no matter how exclusive their restrooms are). I have no sources or math for this, but I don't believe that the minor influx of people into these restrooms would dirty them at a rate faster than the added janitor person could clean with the rest of the janitors.\n\nA lot of touristy places had payable restrooms as well. I can see how one could make the case for a business reserving the restrooms to their customers, but many of these places were just a privatized version of what I described above, selling just water and restroom access.\n\nTo summarize, I believe that the small cost in maintaining a free restroom is outweighed solely in possible financial gains, and completely blown away when considering human rights in addition. Still, I imagine that I cannot be the first person to think of this, so there must be some reason why public spaces were allowed to begin this practice in the first place, so I would like to hear what you think on the matter. CMV please.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. Universities have done an excellent job in creating an environment that has tons of racial, sexual, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it still lacks intellectual and political diversity. People with conservative or right-wing views are [woefully unrepresented](http://www.criticalreview.com/crf/pdfs/klein_stern.pdf) in academia, particularly in the social sciences. Not only does this make people with conservative political views feel unwelcome and unappreciated in the university environment, it threatens the perceived validity of the research done. [This is even recognized by some leftists themselves](https://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/right-wing-study-of-inequality/). How are you supposed to have valid research, let alone critical thinking, when there is an absolute hegemony of leftist views, which no one dares challenge due to their overwhelmingly disproportionate power and influence on campus? Therefore, to make university a more diverse environment and encourage critical thinking, we should prioritize student and faculty applicants who are affiliated with right wing organizations, and ensure that peer review panels have at least one right wing professor on them CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Political Correctness has not only gotten way out of hand, but it is, ultimately, detrimental to a healthy society.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3anfy4", "selftext": "First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however:\n\nWe see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude, distasteful, ignorant, what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution. \n\nIt is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions. \n\nThis post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word \"cisgendered\" and wether it is \"normal\" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through.. it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better.\n\nAdversity is everywhere, it hits everyone.  I may be a man, but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white, but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood, but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is, none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change, doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again, I'm not saying bullying is okay, but the line between what is considered okay to joke about, and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes, trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth.\n\nTL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better.\n\nI hope you don't think i'm terrible for thinking this way, and I would love to hear everyone's input.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even things as simple as watching movies and realized I'm seeing an exponentially larger number of white males than any other group, can remind me that there are things in my life that I take for granted which do not exist, or at least are there to a much smaller degree, in the lives of others. I find this unacceptable; I despise the idea that people are born into set roles or classes due to things outside of their control. No one asks to be born into poverty, or born to be viewed as suspicious just because they take part in activities others can do without question or second looks. \n\nOn the other hand: Every day that I open the news, I find a new article that implies that I am some kind of horrible, racist, monster based only on my gender or the color of my skin. Sites like Salon, Motherjones, and Huffington Post drop hundreds of articles each month about white people AS A GENERALIZED GROUP, as if we're all some sort of problem people, individually. Even college professors like Saida Grundy seem to have no problem saying this... and their Universities have no problem allowing it. Which is part of what bothers me the most... it's not that clickbait articles exist, but rather that NO ONE CARES. \n\n**[EDIT: Edited the example to show a better case for point. Previous link was to the works of Arthur Chu. This is more inclusive]**\nExample:  Take this selection of posts: http://www.salon.com/topic/whats_the_matter_with_white_people/ On this list, replace the word \"White\" with \"Black\" in your head. Look at how horrendously racist that list now comes out to be. And yet, because it says \"White\", it's cool. All is well in the world. Articles that start with \"Kanye West vs. white mediocrity: \" are currently in style.\n\nWell, the problem is that it takes people like me, who WANT to be an ally and WANT to stand up and add another voice to the fray, shouting that things should be better for people who are not white... and it makes me want to remain silent. What could compel me to self loathe to the point of standing beside racists who despise me for the color of my skin, who disparage me for nothing that I did but rather the actions of people unrelated to me that I have never met and only share the single point of connection in the melonin content of our skin? \n\nWhat's the point of trying, if I'm a monster because of how I look and the only way I can \"correct\" that is to disparage myself because of the actions of others? Even just making a post like this, pointing out how digustingly bigotted and racist these views are, will make ME out to be the racist for bringing it up.\n\nI truly do not understand the current path we are taking in race relations. I do not understand how this is supposed to help. I see so many people saying that we need to tackle racism head on, and that we need to talk about the problems... this is me doing that. Even if I get called a racist or a bigot for it, that's ok. I'm talking about the problem, and it IS a problem.\n\nWhy good does alienating allies really accomplish?\n\nEDIT: Deltas have been awarded. Excellent points were made, and I while I still feel some injustice in certain situations on this topic, I do not feel that it is quite the widespread issue I viewed it as when I began. I still feel that the media is causing undue defensiveness with their \"click-bait\" article titles... but otherwise I feel better about the situation.\n\n**EDIT** -  My first gold!

The person I find most notable in this discussion is Jon Stewart: http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/kb2h42/charleston-church-shooting\n    The argument that he is making has merit, Jon Stewart is a highly intelligent and empathetic human being who knows what he is talking about. But the demographic that Dylann Roof crawled away from to represent is an old and dying minority, that I truly believe. Yes, there are race problems and there are people of extreme disturbances that are willing to go to murderous lengths to make a statement about race, but no one with a sensible head on their shoulders believes such things. We should keep the discussion of race alive, and there are lengths that we as a society need to cover to reach the mountain top of racial equality, but why must we blame Charleston and the media as a whole for this one poor young man who had a clear mental health issue, and easy access to firearms? Is it hard for us to turn our minds to the more obvious debate that needs to be made about gun control and mental health treatment? \n     It is an argument that has been made and beaten to death before, and feels a little more ignored this time around. If Dylann Roof had more red tape and more red flags put in his way, maybe this tragedy could have been deterred or at least mitigated. At least, that's one thing in this situation we could have controlled. We could not make race relations better in a few months, nor could we prevent Dylann Roof from changing his mind as easily as one Saturday morning cartoon, but we could have made his actions much harder to go about.\n     There are race relations to address in this country, and that will be healed with more time, but we aren't helping ourselves by making this act more than a symptom of the case. Race relations didn't make Dylann Roof a murderer, his own rage and fractured mental health did, and the glock was far too easy for him to reach. \nI am not trying to disparage the obvious issues between white people, black people, and any other race, but I am not understanding why it is paramount we make this about race, rather than the argument that we have based most other mass-shootings on. So please, CMV.\n     "}

Other languages such as Spanish the pronunciation of a word is pretty straight forward.  I understand that the conjugation is the only tough part and the whole gender thing might be confusing at first (not that crazy if it ends on an a it's female, except agua which can be both, the only tough part is if it end on an e). Also English is not even the most spoken language in the world where Mandarin is first followed by Spanish. English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise.\n\nAlso the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million.\n\nI know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were. I didn't defend Mandarin because I've always had the impression of it being one of the hardest language to master. If it's otherwise I apologize and anyone who speaks other languages are welcome to support why your language should be the international language.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Here's why: I believe in the western world they can't be racist against white people, I agree with the background on that. I disagree that in general they can't be racist though. I believe they can definitely be racist towards other minority ground i.e. Black vs Latino racism. In this context one group could quite easily have systematic power over another simply by controlling trade in an area. As a concept this would essentially be, think about a neighborhood predominately black, with Black-run stores, if a Latino or Asian comes in to set up shop, I'm going to bet he's going to feel racism. \nThe next reason I believe people of color can be racist is foreign countries. I'm really unsure how someone can say in a country where white is not the majority the majority race cannot have systematic oppression against white people or any other minority race for that matter. I am aware that anecdotes are not good evidence, but I've definitely heard my fair share of them, either co-workers and bosses holding you to a much higher standard or simply not believing you can do as good of a job as someone of the majority race to being denied access to public spaces due to your race, it's quite common in foreign countries, even if you were born there and lived there your whole life. \n\nConclusion: Rather than saying people of color can't be racist I think it would be far more helpful to say the majority race can be racist.\n\nI'd love for someone to change my view on this.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: \"If everyone is super, no one will be,\" is not a chilling prediction; it would be a good thing, and \"The Incredibles\" was wrong to give this viewpoint to a villain.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3alov5", "selftext": "It's been awhile since I've seen the movie, but one line has stuck with me for years: \"If everyone's super, no one will be.\" This basically sums up the ideology of the villain of the film: Syndrome is trying to build inventions that would give any user superpower-level abilities, so that \"natural\" superheroes wouldn't be special anymore.\n\nNow, Syndrome is a villain, regardless of his beliefs. He kidnaps the Incredibles and tries to kill at least some of them. He also built a death robot to destroy an entire city (for reasons that I still do not understand). The movie correctly portrays these behaviors as villainous. However, for no apparent reason, Syndrome is acting on a surprisingly positive, egalitarian motive. If they wanted to make a compelling villain, he could have had a simple world domination goal, or just wanted to make himself a superhero. But no: Syndrome's goals are to make \"natural\" superheroes no better than anyone else...by making everyone a superhero. And this is bad, because....?\n\nThe theme gets even weirder at the end, where Dash pretends to be less than stellar at track and gets second place, despite his powers. Apparently, the Incredibles are fine with the appearance of equality, as long as they know they're really superior. In fact, it's nice to let other people PRETEND to be the best, and you don't have to feel threatened by that, because you'll always be the real best. I can't help but view the film as a struggle between two profoundly incorrect viewpoints. I walk away knowing that Syndrome did more evil things, but hating the Incredibles more because they're just so unlikeable.\n\nSyndrome is correctly cast as the villain of the piece because of his bullying of the Incredibles and city destructobot, but his plan to provide cool gadgets for everyone is not evil, and it would not be a bad thing if \"everyone was super.\" On the contrary, it would be the best outcome of the movie. We only get a brief glimpse of Syndrome's inventions, but even the few we see appear to have some potential livesaving applications (flying shoes for firefighters to get people out of burning buildings; laser glasses to rescue people trapped in car accidents). If everyone was super, it wouldn't just be a lucky few tasked with saving people whether they wanted to or not. Instead, those who truly wanted to could do it, and as many people as necessary could have each \"power.\" If we had the technology to do so, we ought to make everyone super. Syndrome's alleged motive for evil falls totally flat, and the Incredibles' reaction is weirdly elitist. CMV.\n\nEdit: My V has been partially C'd. Thanks to u/FlyingMiracle for first pointing out that I misconstrued Syndrome's real goal. His stated plan was to sell his gadgets to the highest bidder, not give them to well-trained service professionals to save lives. He did SAY \"if everyone is super, no one will be\" in a threatening tone of voice, and I still think equality is a dumb motive for a villain. But it doesn't seem to BE his motive at all. He's just going to make the rich and powerful more rich and powerful, and probably destroy the world when tons of rich, inexperienced people fuck shit up with his devices. He claims to be working for equality, but even if he went about his plan without trying to kill the Incredibles or unleash his deathbot, he would still be wreaking havoc, not promoting equality."}

Only a select few have guns (I.E. Farmers can have shotguns to keep wild animals at bay, but only under strict license with regular checks). Members of shooting clubs etc can have guns, but again, only certain types, and the regulations on these are far stricter than in the U.S. \n\nFast forward 19 years and massacres on the scale and regularity in which America is seeing them are unheard of here, and in most other developed countries with bans on guns.\n\nFor context - a single teacher was stabbed to death not too long back by a pupil and the nation was horrified, it was major news for weeks. In the U.S. I don't believe this would raise an eyebrow.\n\nOur police officers can patrol pretty much unarmed, and because there's little to no threat of a thug pulling a gun, officers are a lot less jumpy and combatative toward the general population. This means far fewer people dying in police custody.\n\nAs an outsider looking in, I can't wrap my head around how many lives need to be lost in mass shootings and police killings before Americans realise that guns have no place in the hands of the general population. Quite a few Americans would need a new hobby, but this would be a small price to pay to minimise these kind of events. It's fact that when guns are ridiculously hard to obtain that these types of crimes occur less than in places where most people can freely buy them. America should ban guns.\n\nCMV."}

I don't believe masking or avoiding reality is ever a good thing, and we can easily push for equal rights and respect for all transsexuals, even if people reserve the word normal when it comes to gender for someone who is cisgendered. \n\nEdit: wow, I was not expecting this many responses, or for this to be something other people found interesting.

I understand that zoos do some good in taking in endangered animals, but only a relatively small percentage of the animals in the zoo are endangered in the first place and I don't believe that the majority of the animals should sufferer for the benefit of the smaller. Side note, sanctuaries exist for this reason. They are capable of handling one animal well and they can also make money from donations/tours.\n\nEven then, the endangered animals do not belong in a zoo. Endangered species are not sentient. The individual animal is. The individual animal has right to freedom, even if that means becoming extinct. Extinction in the wild is not an excuse to continue keeping individuals in captivity. The survival of the species does not justify the loss of freedom for the individuals in captivity.\n\nSecondly, animals in captivity experience many mental illness signs such as depression, PTSD, shakes among others. These are symptoms that aren't seen in their wild counterparts. Some chimpanzees have even been seen to self-mutilate, repetitive rocking and consumption of feces, which again, are not seen in wild counterparts.\n\nNow, these symptoms are usually seen in lab monkeys (which I will not be going into) however, this has also been seen in monkeys living in good zoos. All 40 of the observed chimps did some kind of abnormal behavior, ranging from poking their own eyes and other body parts, drinking urine, pulling their hair, bang themselves against surfaces and other things that wild chimps don't do.\n\n\nThirdly, animals are killed that have certain diseases. I can't recall the exact article, however there were a group of monkeys in a zoo (I think they may have been in England) they had a disease that was nonfatal to them. In the wild these monkeys would live normal lives and do monkey things. However, this disease is fatal to humans, and as suck they put them all down. Now while I believe this is a rather rare scenario, it can happen. \n\n\nLastly, and I *know* this will be brought up because it's brought up a lot. People always mention how good zoos are for showing children animals they would otherwise never get to see in person. While I do agree this is a good thing, and it makes children appreciate the world (and get into science more at a young age) I do believe that museums can fill this same role, and without the moral issues that I brought up. \n\n\nTo summarize, I don't think that the pros of zoos outweight the cons. You wouldn't say the that [insert hate group/military group] is good because they protect their own people. You can't subtract the bad because of some good things.\n\nIf I had to give this post a TL;DR it would basically be: Zoos are immoral places that do some good, but in the end, I believe that anything a zoo does well, a museum or sanctuary can do better.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Dog fighting should be legalized, taxed, and regulated at animal shelters.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ajn0a", "selftext": "In much the same way as drugs, prostitution, gambling, or other \"victimless\" crimes, dog fighting is going to happen irrespective of the law.  Legalization would lead to increased tax revenue, less organized crime. and safer, more humane environments for all those involved.  It would also end the practice of baiting game dogs with helpless puppies and the like.\n\nI understand that many would argue that the dogs are victims (as are drug addicts and prostitutes for that matter), but only in the sense that eating horse meat (which is illegal in many places) victimizes horses, or even horse racing, which is already legalized, taxed, and regulated in controlled environments.\n\nThe fact is countless dogs are already being put to death in animal shelters, often at the taxpayers' expense.  Revenue from dog fighting could alleviate this cost considerably, perhaps even allowing animals to be kept longer, increasing their chances of adoption.  Highly aggressive dogs are unlikely to ever be adopted however (except perhaps by illegal dog-fighting fans currently), nor should they be.  \n\nIt would only be the aggressive dogs used in fights, as they're clearly willing. That's why they need to be kept in separate cages, otherwise they'd be mauling each other of their own volition.  Dogs too old, young, sickly, or cowardly to fight could still be put down as usual since they would make for unentertaining match-ups and would be bad for gambling.\n\nEven the dogs that do fight would receive better medical treatment afterwards from veterinarians on hand, and/or humane euthanasia rather than drowning, hanging, etc.  You certainly wouldn't get the likes of a Michael Vick doing a Pete Townshend impression with a terrier in place of a guitar.  \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Hence they should be held in high esteem and follow their moral examples, even if we don't agree with their religious views", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3aith1", "selftext": "Hello there. \n\nI am a guy from Bangladesh, a highly conservative Islamic country. English is not my native language. I will still try to explain the issue to the best of my ability. If you do not understand something, do ask for clarifications. Furthermore, I do not intend to offend anyone, so please don't take it otherwise. \n\nI should also say that I am very irreligious, and I am just a Muslim officially. Other than that my views fall in the camp of Liberal Agnosticism. In other words I tend to support contemporary Western social values on morality to some extent. \n\nAnyways the thing is, I believe that most devoutly religious people are on on the whole good people. If you take a weighing scale and place their good and bad deeds, the scale of righteousness will be many times more heavier than the scale of evil. This would be mostly true for followers of any religion. If someone has lead all their life strictly adhering to their religion, it is highly likely that these people are on the whole *many times moral than the average Westerner or the Common people of the world* \n\nSince they are many times more moral than the common people of the world, especially the West, these people should be held in high esteem. Even if we don't agree with their views, we should still accept that they are a better person than us and we should aspire to follow in their moral path, even if we do not follow their religious path. We should also place them on a pedestal or have a very high esteem for them and make them leaders among our people. \n\nI have seen a lot of hatred and mockery towards this group by most Westerners, especially Reddit. People here are always saying \"Dont Preach here, you ****\" and things along those lines. People seem to consider themselves on par or atleast better than devoutly religious people even if they are themselves sleeping around.  \n\nSure you could argue that there are examples of religious people being criminals, but that is in the minority. This ofcourse does not mean, that their actions against other human beings would be ignored.

{"title": "CMV: I cannot return to \"normal\" after an existential crisis.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3aimk2", "selftext": "I don't even know where to start. \n\n\n\nI am generally a happy and healthy person. I was raised Catholic. I am not a strict Catholic. I enjoy the community of church. I don't take everything at face value or for fact. About 8 years ago I came to terms that there is probably no Heaven. Death is just ceasing to exist. I was okay with that. I still felt we had souls or spirits. I still hoped for or had affection for the possibility of a God, even though it probably didn't exist. I still hoped for an afterlife of some sort, even though I didn't know what it would manifest as and that the chance of one was actually quite slim. I felt my children were a blessing. Their births were the most beautiful, tender days of my life. I took joy and pride in everything my kids did. Some days I would just well up with pride and happiness, so happy that our lives have been rich and lucky. Any thoughts of death or mortality were far, far from my mind. I just didn't think about those types of things. Sure, the thoughts flitted through my mind every now and then and I would think about them. I would discuss it with my spouse. Usually I would take comfort in the intense love and happiness we have and know that no matter what happens at the end, somehow we would still go on, whether it be in the hearts or memories of others, in some type of spirit/soul that survived death, in photos or videos . . . The jury was out on what happens, but I was at least accepting or positive about it. \n\n\n\n\nNow, I feel like a shattered, empty person.\n\n\n\n\nAs I've gotten older, I have developed high blood pressure (family history). My doctor put me on Atenolol 50mg once a day. About four days in, I started to feel sad and question my mortality and my family's mortality out of nowhere. Things just spiraled out of control after that. I learned about nihilism, atheism, existentialism, what happens after death, that we are just computers, emotions aren't real, just by-products of brain impulses ... just lots of things I never thought about before and I became incredibly depressed. Crying everyday, scared of the eventuality of our lives, the meaningless of life, the possible lack of a soul, no proof of an afterlife ... I feel like I've been down a horribly dark rabbit hole and I want to get out.\n\n\n\n\nI went back to my doctor and he said Atenolol, being a beta blocker, can cause depression, so he took me off of it. I was on it for two weeks. My last dose was about 96 hours ago. I'm not feeling much better. How long does it take the medication to get out of my system and for all my brain chemistry to start working again? I'm having a lot of trouble finding meaning in what I do, and what I do with my family since there's no point. We won't remember anything after we die. Why do I care if I get some award at work? What do I care if my kid gets in the school play? Why celebrate someone's birthday? I feel empty. I feel hollow. I do not want to feel like this.\nCould this really all be a cause of the medicine? Or did I do this to myself? Will my feelings of happiness and excitement come back? Will I find meaning again? How long until I could be \"back to normal?\" \n\n\n\n\nThis current depressive state is so unlike me and nothing I have ever experienced before. I'm scared I'll always have these depressing thoughts about mortality and life's meaning that I just don't want in my head anymore. I want to rewind the last two weeks and go back to my jovial, excited, proud self that I was. I want to believe in what I used to believe in. I feel like now that I've researched what really happens after death, or researched that we probably have no souls, that we are just a product of brain chemistry, that I can never go back to how I was. I WANT to, though. I feel like now that I've gotten a peek at what we really are (sophisticated computers) that I can never be happy again. I don't want to know these truths. I want to go back to how I was. I am losing meaning in anything I do.  I am becoming detatched from my children and spouse. I don't enjoy doing anything with them. It's all just a reminder that they will die someday, too. I don't want to live in a world where they don't exist, but that's where I am destined to be and it destroys me. I can't look at my kids and be happy anymore, knowing that anything we do is meaningless. Yes, I know there are the arguments that YOU have to provide meaning and make something out of the life you are given, but that doesn't help me feel better at all. It makes me feel worse. I feel like I have to work now to assign or find meaning, rather than it just naturally occurring and flowing and being part of my day-to-day life. My kid drew a picture today and happily showed me. All I could muster was a \"nice job,\" instead of my usual effortless pride and happiness in how he was developing and growing.  \n\n\n\n\nEach time I try to make myself feel better, I ruin it.  I tell myself that it is possible all humans, animals have souls. I know there is no scientific proof right now (except for the Lanza theories which I am not sold on), but I feel it's possible for everyone to just have that essential spark in them. Then I feel better, but then realize that our consciousness is just our brains tricking us into thinking we are an \"I\" or we are a \"self.\" That it's impossible for a soul to exist. Where in evolution would we even have developed one? What happened to all the beings in death who didn't have souls? Or were souls present in the primordial ooze we came from? See, that's just not realistic.  I look up stuff online which just confirms this bleakness. There's no hope anymore. Pre-Atenolol me wouldn't have thought these thoughts. Now I'm destroyed by them. Now I'm just thinking that every memory I make, every experience I have is for nothing. \n\n\n\n\nI just want to go back to my happy, silly, proud self. Is this all just the medicine? I want to take pride in my family again. I want the little things to become important again. I want to be carefree and hopeful again. However, I feel now that I've gotten a glimpse of the dark and painful truths of our existence that I'm going to never be able to get over this crisis, never get these thoughts out of my head, and never be happy again for the rest of my life. This terrifies me. I just want to be who I was again, but it think that's impossible. \n\n\n\n\nPlease, please change my view. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Several people mentioned the idea that people only matter as long as they live and as long as they are remembered which is also true. \n\nAll of these things may be helpful IF it appears that the person doesn't already know it and would benefit from this point of view.

So please don't vilify me for my views, I'm asking you to please change them.\n\nAlso, when I say \"animal\", I mean animals that aren't humans. I see violence/torture of humans completely differently.\n\nBasically, I have no problem with torturing, killing, doing anything imaginable to animals, and they don't set off an emotional response. We (read: most Westerners) eat animals, we kill millions unconsciously because of our actions, and we actively eradicate tons of insects and rodents every year. We even enslave them to either give us joy or provide manual labor for us.\n\nThere are a few caveats to my \"indifference\" though:\n\n(1) I understand most people are offended when animals get hurt, or see this as cruel. Because I respect other people, I won't hurt their pets since this would distress them. By the same token, I would never harm service animals (guide dogs, therapy pets, rescue animals), but more so because I respect the value they provide for other humans.\n\n(2) I do not condone killing species of animals recklessly. We live on a planet that depends on tons of fragile ecosystems. Allowing one species of animals to go extinct could damage our planet (and therefore by extension come back to bite us) and therefore I support conservation efforts to save animal species world-wide.\n\nIf you're confused as to what exactly my view is, basically I don't see a problem when people abuse animals. Calls to save animals from cosmetic testing, stop pet owners from hurting their pets, or (even going so far as) save animals from bestiality, all fall on deaf ears.\n\nSo that's my view.

Watney establishes contact with NASA by driving over to the Sojurner rover and stealing/fixing it to transmit to Earth (which...*awesome*).\n\nA few plans are developed to save him, one involving a hastily built probe to resupply him which blows up on takeoff.  That first one I buy.  But the latter plans I don't.  And I have two principal objections.\n\nFirst, it seems like NASA executives make the calls on these.  This would not be the case.  It would be the President of the United States making the ultimate decision to greenlight projects.  And at that level, it seems very unlikely that they'd get the greenlight.  The independence of NASA in the book is greatly at odds with how I see government agencies working.\n\nThe Chinese government would not give a large booster over to NASA like they did.  This is portrayed as happening at the agency level coordinating with the Chinese space agency and then presenting it to political leaders as a fait accompli.\n\nThe plan is super-risky though, and depends on a single resupply mission with a quickly built supply ship - one of which just blew up on the pad.  If the resupply doesn't work, all 6 astronauts die.  Or 5, if they do space cannibalism.\n\nI just don't think the governments of two countries who don't get along great would coordinate to waste hundreds of millions to billions of dollars (the plan also scrubs Ares 4 by taking its ascent vehicle), all to have a very low chance of rescuing one guy at the substantial risk to 5 more people.  And the Hermes mutiny to force the government's hand just seems absurdly implausible to me.\n\nMuch more likely is that Watney would have been asked to compose letters to whomever he wanted, perform science til his food ran out (assuming he was willing) and then take a lethal dose of morphine.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You're still guilty of whatever you're guilty of. \n\nHowever, the law code in just about every civilized country is more confusing than Chinese Calculus. Every one of us probably breaks at least one law a day. I also took one year of law classes in community college, which makes a reddit expert, so here are my thoughts:\n\n1) It should be misdemeanors only. You shouldn't be able to claim ignorance on a felony. Those are too severe. \n\n2) It should be an affirmative defense, which means you have to prove your ignorance. You can't just say \"I didn't know.\" You'd have to prove it was an obscure law that defies common sense. This puts the burden of proof on the defendant which means it couldnt be abused.\n\n3) Examples of this could be:\n\nIf you're going 35 in a 25 and get pulled over, but the path you took on that road did not contain any speed limit signs.

However, I don't think that has any bearing on blackface today. What if an actor of another race simply wanted to portray a black character, and so they darkened the color of their skin to make their appearance more accurate? There could be absolutely no mocking of race going on, and people will still shout \"racism!\"\n\nFor example, I know a white girl who tried to do an impression of Michelle Obama. She dressed up in blackface and made jokes about healthy eating and vegetables and whatnot. She got torn apart on social media for being racist. Although I can see how this impression is in bad taste, I cannot see how it is racist. She only made fun of Michelle Obama's campaigning, and she never once made fun of her race at all. And yet, it was still considered racist."}
{"title": "CMV: Goldeneye 007 is useful only as a historical artifact and is, functionally, vastly inferior to today's FPS games.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3aco44", "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for this; they did the best they could with what they had at the time, and if you compare it to Duke Nukem 64 or SNES Doom it beats them by a landslide. \n\nGoldeneye was absolutely revolutionary for its time, and shaped the path of future FPS games. However, by today's standards, it is absolutely awful and is outclassed in literally every way by today's games.  This is for a number of reasons, including mechanics, controls, and map variety. Despite this, many people choose to play Goldeneye, even though it is crap. \n\nIt's not even moderately close-ish who wins between, say, Battlefield 4 or Goldeneye. However, since I know you guys are going to point out the massive price disparity between buying a PS3/X360 with 4 controllers and an N64 with 4 controllers, I'm going to instead compare it with Timesplitters 2 on the PS2, which I believe to hold up far better today. A PS2 with 4 controllers and TS2 costs you $50 + $10x4 + $10 = $100. (Amazon prices) An N64 with 4 controllers and Goldeneye costs you $50 + $20x4 + $15 = $145. (Amazon prices) All of this is used.\n\nLet's first compare game mechanics. It makes sense that Goldeneye's game mechanics are less complex than Timesplitters 2's because the controller has fewer buttons. In Goldeneye you have the ability to do the following: aim, move, zoom in, fire, perform contextual actions, and switch weapons in one direction. Timesplitters 2 offers all of that as well as the ability to crouch and reload, as well as cycle backward and forward through your weapons. Of course, both of these games' mechanical complexities pale in comparison to today's FPS games, which add sprinting, jumping, and more.\n\nNext, controls. The N64's lack of dual analog makes the clear winner TS2. Other than that, they pretty much have the same control scheme. Props to Goldeneye for having more variety, but most of the variety is exceptionally poorly thought out schemes where moving and aiming are mixed between the C buttons and the analog stick.\n\nFinally, there is map variety. Due to the limitations of the N64, all of Goldeneye's maps are basically the same: completely indoor mazes of hallways and doors. Granted, there is much more variety than on most games of this type in that era, but compare this to TS2. You can CREATE YOUR OWN MAPS and many of the pre-created maps are outdoors. The maps also feel very different: the difference between Caves and Library is nothing compared to between Circus and Hangar, for instance.\n\nAll these points are why I feel that Goldeneye 007 is a relic of the past and if you're looking for a multiplayer FPS experience you are better off looking elsewhere. In fact, other than \"because I played it as a kid,\" or \"because I own no consoles newer than the N64,\" I don't think there is any reason at all to play Goldeneye.

{"title": "CMV: It's disingenuous to downplay political motivators in favor of mental illness when discussing mass murders.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3ach32", "selftext": "So if you haven't heard already, there was a recent [shooting in a Charleston church.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3a8k4r/breaking_active_shooting_downtown_charleston/) Many reports are coming out with evidence that points it as a racially motivated hate crime. (I'm not here to argue whether or not it was, as the investigation is still ongoing and many developments have yet to come, but for the purpose of this discussion I'm going to assume it was.)  \n\nMuch like with the Elliot Rodgers case, there are many people already stating that this is purely a mental health issue and it's just the liberal media drumming up a race war and etc.  \n\nI don't think it's fair to detract from those arguments, as there are many many people with mental illnesses living non-violently. Even if people with certain mental illnesses have a higher chance of committing violence, and even if most mass murderers do have some kind of mental illness, it shouldn't detract from the fact that there are social motivators that led them ultimately to taking others' lives. The reason I say it's \"disingenuous\" to downplay them is because it allows people who believe there's nothing wrong (eg. that racism is still a major problem) to persuade others that there's nothing wrong, even though there's evidence in the form of the killings that there's still a problem. \n\nIn this case, it was the suspect's surrounding himself with racist rhetoric that led him so far down a path of hatred towards black people that he acted violently against them. In Elliot Rodger's case, it was his intense hatred of women not sleeping with him (and resentment of other men he saw as his 'competitors') that ultimately led him to go on his spree.  \n\nI believe that bigoted hatred should also be addressed alongside mental illness, and shouldn't be downplayed by the media or the public whenever these issues arise. Especially since not all killers are mentally ill, and so addressing these motivators will still help reduce violence."}
{"title": "CMV: Nearly all landlords should allow dogs in apartments", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3acd0j", "selftext": "I have lived in Boston for nearly five years and am currently searching for my 3rd apartment in the area (my moves have been because of either price or commute). I have a small dog (12 pounds, 5 years old) and my probable roommate also has a dog (70 pounds, 10 years old). During each move, I have had trouble finding a landlord who will accept dogs, and finding one that accepts two feels nearly impossible. \n\nI have always received full pet deposits back and have reference letters from previous landlords, but this does not seem to factor into their policies. The most common reasons they bring up are noise, yard waste, and possible damage to apartment (mainly floors and walls). Having lived next to families with young children and beneath freshly minted college graduates, I cannot understand the bias against dogs.\n\nYes, my dog barks when the doorbell rings or there is noise in the stairwell, but she calms down after a couple minutes and has been trained so I can get her to sit and quiet almost immediately when I'm home. On the other hand, the baby I lived by would cry loud enough to be heard in my apartment and was often difficult to calm down. The young guys upstairs often play music loud enough to be heard in other apartments (even outside the building) and we had a lengthy struggle with our property manager to get their behavior under control. Why should dogs be singled out as being a noise issue?\n\nAnd yes, my dog's nails have made some scratches on the floor and in the paint. Children often play with toys that can and do cause the exact same damage. The stairwell in my current building is all scratched up from neighbors moving furniture (and the entryway light was broken during one move) and the guys upstairs constantly drop beer cans (by their own admission) and have weights they shift across the floor almost daily. Again: why single dogs out as problematic? And isn't this exactly what the security deposit is intended to cover?\n\nRegarding the yard, which I suppose is dog specific: I have a scoop and clean up after my dog every time. This is exactly the kind of information contained in the references from my previous landlords. If considered on a case by case basis, I see no reason this \"issue\" isn't avoidable.\n\nIn short: why is it okay to single dogs out as potential problems and usable as an excuse to refuse tenancy? I understand that the laws *allow* them to do so whereas they can't deny an application based on age or having children; I disagree with this as well. Either landlords can discriminate for *any* reason that may cause sound or damage, OR they must allow them all (including dogs). I hesitate to use a loaded word like \"discrimination\", but it's hard to resist, especially seeing as people who choose to have children are protected but those who choose to have pets are heavily restricted.\n\nFURTHERMORE, I believe changing their policy would actually benefit the landlords (especially early on). When so many apartments disallow pets, the ones they open their doors would have a wider pool of potential tenants. In many places (definitely in Boston), the rental market has numerous issues that need to be addressed and the landlords currently hold all the cards, so this benefit isn't immediately obvious. Still, I believe it would bear out in an overall more fair market.\n\nPS - I would understand some policies relating to location and breed, such as not allowing dogs over 100 pounds in an apartment with less than 500 square feet or something, but that would be for the dog's safety. Restrictions on breeds for being \"too violent\" seem very problematic and I believe should be examined on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTL;DR: Dogs are, on average, no worse than children or simply irresponsible/inconsiderate adults, so landlords should not be able to deny tenancy to pet owners.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I feel like the Republicans are the 'bad guys' PLEASE CMV!", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ac4qi", "selftext": "I've drunk the koolaide. I'm becoming a biased partisan hack. I believe that one of the biggest problems with this country is the deep, seemingly irreconcilable animosity between the followers of the two parties, and I am part of that problem. \n\n\n\nYet as much as I try, I cannot bring myself to view the Republicans as anything but a regressive influence on the USA. On some deep level, I've accepted the stereotype that Republican voters are bible thumping, gun wielding, blindly patriotic semi-racists. I'm not talking so much about the elected officials but rather the voters. I feel that, from what I can gather through the 'liberal' media and my personal experience, Republican opinions are largely formed (at least more so than Democrats) on ignorance, xenophobia, religion, guns, and hatred for Obama. I know such a broad and negative stereotype can't really be true, but I still can't shake it. I don't pretend to understand much about economics so most of my feelings come from my revulsion with the party's stance on social issues. \n\n\n\nHere are a few bits of my limited understanding of the party's platform:\n\n\n\nSocial Issues: \n\n- Opposing gay marriage: I have tried to find a credible argument against gay marriage, but have repeatedly failed. Currently, their argument before the supreme court rests on gays being unfit to raise children/procreate and the floodgates opening for polygamy etc.  \n\n- Downplaying racial/gender discrimination as out of control political correctness: This seems like mostly suburban/rural white men being unable to empathize with groups of people they've never/rarely met. And some genuine racism.\n\n- Defensiveness over religion/guns: The gun debate is too muddied for me to have a strong opinion on, but I feel Republicans' fears over attacks on Christianity are largely unfounded and that, if anything, Christianity has too large an influence on our culture/government.\n\n- Immigration: I don't understand the positives/negatives of different approaches to immigration, but the Republican voter's opposition seems to come from xenophobia and trumped up fear about terrorists/freeloaders sneaking in.\n\n\n\nSecurity Issues:\n\n- Support for aggressive policing and invasive homeland security: I realize Rand and Co have been at the forefront of action against the NSA, but my personal experience has left me believing that most Republican voters are for strengthening national security and increasing military spending. I also feel that the strongest voices to come out in support of the recent police-on-black violence were conservatives.\n\n- Hawkish foreign policy: I feel that Republicans have an emotional and aggressive reaction to Russia, Iran, Syria, ISIS and would be more willing to intervene militarily without regard to whether or not such intervention would be beneficial. They seem willing to pursue cathartic violence and disinclined to examined our militaries checkered past.\n\n\n\nEconomic Issues:\n\n- Welfare Queens: Again, I really don't understand enough about economics to judge a good policy from a bad one, but I see the Republicans as using the idea of welfare queens to scare up opposition to social programs and further stigmatize the poor. They view Obamacare/Goverment assistance as handouts given to the undeserving.\n\n- Blame the poor: It feels like Republicans push the idea that, without regulations, people will be able to pull themselves out of poverty and that the only thing keeping them down is either the government or their own laziness.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Issues:\n\n- Global warming skepticism: This seems motivated by the party's ties to fossil fuel, fear of change, hatred for anything Obama, and anti-intellectual disdain for 'nancy-pansy' green stuff.\n\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR - I feel like the Republican voting base is motivated primarily by religion, xenophobia, fear of change, hatred for Obama. Their positions are ignorant, contradict available evidence, short sighted, and selfish. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would change my mind?\n\n-Evidence of a largely liberal leaning media/culture that suppresses honest Republican voices and prevents me from seeing the other side of the picture.\n\n-Evidence that Republican news media (Fox, Breibart, Drudge, Talk Radio, etc) are reputable and not fear mongering propaganda barkers. \n\n-Strong arguments supporting the Republican platform and evidence that Republican voters share these views.\n\n-Surprise me!\n\n\n\nTHANK YOU and please please please help me shed this ugly bias!!!\n\n\nEDIT#1: Just wanted to thank everyone for the incredibly thoughtful responses.

{"title": "CMV: We should be tolerant of ALL people regarding what they identify as, including transracial people", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3ac0qy", "selftext": "Here is what I believe: **We should be tolerant of people regarding what they identify as, EVEN if it looks odd or even wrong to us, IF:**\n\n1. **We have reasonable reason to believe they honestly identify that way.** Since identity is a personal, subjective matter, we should default to believing people, with the only exceptions being something like someone caught on a recording saying \"i'm just trolling people lol\".\n2. **They work to appear consistent with that identity.** What I mean here is that it is silly for a person to say, \"I identify as a blueberry pancake,\" but otherwise look and behave like a human being (because pancakes don't). For people to be accepted by others as their identity, they must realize it, or at least try. Just saying \"I identify as tall\" is not enough for a short person to be accepted as tall, but the short person could wear lifts, or undergo surgery. It might still be impossible for them to \"pass\" as tall even with those things (given current medical science), but still, we should be tolerant of them - they are doing their best.\n3. **The person must cause no harm to others** while doing so. I do **not** include \"making others a little uncomfortable\" here, but rather actual harm, solid evidence that accepting people identifying as X would cause undeniable harm to other people in some way. For example, accepting people that identify as something that prevents them from vaccinating their children could be debated as causing harm to others.\n\nI think these 3 conditions are general rules by which we should handle all cases, in order to be fair. And we as a society have been, and in some ways still are, very inconsistent. Here are some examples:\n\n * 100 years ago, a trans woman had no options for hormones or surgery. The best she could do is makeup, women's clothes, and so forth. but **she still qualified** by my 3 conditions: She honestly identified as a woman, she worked to appear consistent with it, and no one was harmed by it. So society should have accepted her, but sadly back then they mostly didn't.\n * Today, Rachel Dolezal **also qualifies**: She honestly identifies as black (lived as black for 10 years, studied African American topics all her life, used darker crayons to draw self-portraits even as a child, etc.), she works to appear consistent with that identity (and indeed she passed as black for 10 years), and no one is hurt (she was even president of the NAACP in her area, a productive and respected member of her community). (She might have some personality issues as well, but those are separate from her identity as black. One can be transracial or gay or whatever but also an idiot or a criminal, the categories have no connection.)\n * [Trans-abled](https://liberationcollective.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/trans-abled-just-another-disability/) people also qualify.\n * As already mentioned, a short person identifying as tall could qualify, even if we don't currently have surgical options for them. The same was true of trans people 100 years ago, but they were still trans and should have been accepted as their chosen gender; ditto for trans-tall people (and hopefully better surgical options for increasing or decreasing height will show up, no reason why not).\n\nNow, I agree it might look \"silly\" to us for Dolezal to say she is black. But what counts as \"silly\" changes! The test of whether we are a tolerant society is in precisely those situations where someone seems a little silly, or makes us a little uncomfortable, but we should still tolerate them despite that. It's their life, their identity, none of our business to judge them.\n\nNote that scientific evidence **does not show up** in my 3 conditions, above. It is **not** going to convince me if someone says \"Rachael isn't biologically black\" (whatever that could even mean), see for example [this discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/39twuk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_biology_of/) regarding trans people, showing both how confusing the science is, and how it shouldn't matter. This isn't a matter for science, it is a matter for society. It's a matter of basic decency and ethics.\n\ntl;dr: We should be a tolerant society, **even** of people that look \"silly\" to us.\n\nCMV - am I hopelessly naive here?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: If you support the right for transgender people to use the restrooms and locker rooms of their choice, you have to let all people chose which room to use", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3abpt5", "selftext": "Given the claim that transgender people should be able to choose whichever restroom or locker room they choose based on their own self-identification, it is illogical to say that I, as a man, should not be able to choose to go into a women's restroom or locker room. For simplicity, I will use just \"restroom\" going forward, but mean for these to be treated equally unless you have an argument that hinges on a distinction between a locker room and restroom.  \n\nLet's leave aside the single-user restrooms, as we know that people of all types use the \"wrong\" room at times due to lines, messiness, out of order, etc., and no one thinks that's a big deal. \n\nLet's assume it is valid for a man to say he feels like a woman and that identity crisis / condition justifies his choice of restroom. If that is the case, surely it is not his wearing of women's apparel that conveys that right upon him. If that were so, any man could dress as a woman and that would earn him the right to use the restroom of his choice. The same argument would be made for any gender specific behavior (wearing of lipstick, shaving his beard, carrying a purse, etc). \n\nFurther supporting the claim that it cannot be behavior is the idea that is a logical prerequisite for transgender to be an accepted idea: that gender is a social construct. If this is the case, a natural man can dress and act in ways that society expects of women and still fully identify as a man. \n\nTherefore, it is only the internal situation, the mental state, that makes the difference between whether he can go into the women's room or not. If that is the case, there can clearly be no independent rule for determining if he is \"serious enough\" about it to make it acceptable (and legal, depending on local laws) to stroll into a women's restroom. \n\nI can anticipate two substantial arguments:\n\n1.  Most transgender people have brain chemistry / structure that corresponds to the opposite sex (sex dysphoria), so there is a biological link that is definite and verifiable. Rebuttal: This is not the case for all transgender people, so while some people may be \"certifiably\" qualified to use the other restroom, there isn't any bright line to tell us who isn't so qualified. Further, there are those who do not identify with either gender. Should those people be told that their gender identity doesn't matter and that they should have to use a particular restroom based on sex at birth? \n\n2. Transgender people have years of therapy and possibly surgery, and that is what gives them the right to choose to use the restroom of the opposite sex. Rebuttal: This would mean that any transgender person who hasn't sought therapy or surgery, for any reason, including cost, availability, etc., does not have that right. \n\nI am sure some will also focus on the safety issue, saying that it is safer for a transgendered person to use the restroom that corresponds to his/her identity. However, that does not in any way impact the argument that others should also be able to have a choice. \n\nObliviously, some support unisex restrooms as a solution, but that is a technical solution, not a rebuttal to this argument. \n\nIn short, I should be able to use whatever restroom or locker room that I want, without question, because no one has any way to verify or validate my gender identity. If it is not based on my genitals, there is no valid basis for telling me I must use the men's room. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: The United States lags behind other nations because of its size and heterogeneity", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3abfdn", "selftext": "Hello CMV,\n\nAs I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in comparison to other nations in categories such as [infrastructure](http://www.statista.com/statistics/264753/ranking-of-countries-according-to-the-general-quality-of-infrastructure/), [poverty rates](http://www.epi.org/publication/ib339-us-poverty-higher-safety-net-weaker/), [education](http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking), and so on. Usually, these show other nations, typically Scandinavian and other European countries, consistently coming out on top. \n\nThis leads to a somewhat negative and unhealthy perception of America for both citizens and non-citizens that I think is unfair. This is because, in my view, there are 3 factors which hinder America's ability to keep up with its developed nation counter parts:\n\n* Land Size\n* Population\n* Cultural Heterogeneity \n\nFirst, here is a top 5 list of the largest nations on Earth by square mileage, in order from largest to smallest:\n\n* Russia\n* Canada\n* China\n* United States\n* Brazil \n\nThe US is the 4th largest country on the planet, and as such, I think its ability to manage and update infrastructure is limited. A bullet train similar to those in Europe would be difficult in the US. Also, land from coast to coast is extremely diverse, ranging from plains, to mountains, to desert, to swamps, and so forth. Such a diverse biome requires diverse management of resources and is pretty difficult in my opinion. \n\nNow here's a top 5 list of countries by population, from largest to smallest:\n\n* China\n* India\n* United States \n* Indonesia \n* Brazil \n\nNot only is America massive in terms of land area, it has a massive population as well. This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems. (This is not to say America *wisely* spends its money on its people, but that is a separate argument for another day). And yet compared to the other 4 most populous nations, it still maintains a high standard of living, relatively low poverty rate, and economic mobility. \n\nThe only other country that hangs with America in *both* categories is China, which is massive in size and population. But America differs from China in one way, which is my third point -- a heterogeneous culture. \n\nThe US was founded by immigrants, as a nation of immigrants, and diversity is only growing into the future. America features such a mixing pot of ethnicity and culture that it makes it difficult to enact programs that benefit everyone equally. I think this is most evident in education, where the US has the difficult task of creating a system that benefits *every* child in the best way possible. In China, a largely homogeneous population with high value on education *should* produce high results. \n\nAnd yet, despite having all three of these factors to consider, the United States is ranked [5th on the Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) as late as 2014.\n\nSo, basically my argument is this -- The United States, being huge in size, huge in population, and having a heterogeneous culture, is at an instant disadvantage in comparison to other nations, and is doing pretty well for itself all things considered. \n\nCMV! \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Gender fluidity is not a thing.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3abaqq", "selftext": "In response to this [article](http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a28865/ruby-rose-oitnb/). I believe you can be a man or a woman or trans, and you can be any sexual orientation you want under the rainbow! Every persons orientation is a little nuanced. I don't believe you're gender can be nuanced. You are a man or a woman, whether you were born that way or you underwent physical changes later in life because you knew deep down that you were a man/woman under the skin you were born in. I don't believe you can make a daily choice to identify as a different gender. So you are a girl who hates skirts? You aren't a man because of that, you are just a girl who hates skirts. Not conforming to gender roles doesn't mean that you have the choice to identify yourself as a different gender whenever you please.   \nWhen a trans person switches, they have to jump through all sorts of hoops to legally be a gender. If we recognized \"gender fluidity\" all sorts of problems could arise, such as \"which change room should I use?\". Would it just change depending on how they were feeling that day? Would we all be okay with men, deciding that they are more of a woman today, going into female change rooms and stripping down in front of children?  \nI don't believe that people really feel the need to change their genders on a daily basis, and I don't agree with those who would try to force me to respect their \"fluid\" gender. There is already a term for people who don't conform to gender stereotypes and it's androgyny. I consider myself to be a very open person, especially when it comes to other peoples personal choices that don't affect me so please CMV.  \nEDIT: u/Paimon has changed my view about gender fluidity being a thing. It's a thing. I still disagree with most of you saying there are no legal or social ramifications though, especially about the change rooms, and on how to address someone who is gender fluid.    \nEDIT 2: A lot of people are trying to change my view based on what they think the world should be like (i.e gender neutral bathrooms and change rooms) rather than being realistic about what it actually is (women have to be guarded in order to protect themselves from sexual harassment.) I still don't believe that men with biological man parts should be allowed to waltz into a women's change room because they are feeling like a woman that day, and that I should just trust that they know better than I do what their gender is when their dick is in my face.  \nThat being said I understand how they is a good term over he/she. It sounds weird to call a girl a they but if someone asked me to refer to them that way, obviously I would. "}
{"title": "CMV: The term \"African American\" should be cast aside in favor of a more accurate classification, likely \"Black\" or something like it.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3aav96", "selftext": "I believe that \"African-American\" is an invention of an overly-PC culture that doesn't actually address what it intends to address. Clearly this post deals most with the US, as I don't even know what other predominantly white countries use as an identifier. \n\nThe vast majority of the time anybody uses the term \"African American\", it is intended to speak to the person's appearance, not their centuries-old heritage. When discussing issues like racism, your appearance is what matters and your appearance isn't \"African American\", it's a darker complexion. If you were at an African cultural festival or something, then the term might be appropriate, but otherwise it's not. \n\n\"Black\" is  by far a more appropriate classification for conversations about race. Were you harassed by police because of your skin tone, or because your great-great-great-great-great-great grandparent was from Africa? There are obviously other physical characteristics (hair, facial construction, etc) that generally go along with the complexion, but the one that is most readily identifiable is skin tone. People also already associate \"Black\" with those attributes.\n\nFurther, many Black people don't identify as African American. Many of them immigrated directly from non-African countries or had parents who did the same. A Black person from England isn't classified as an African-European-American, despite that being more accurate. Additionally, many White people DO meet the requirements of being African-American, having been born there or had some family stop-over there, but obviously in a discussion about race, their experiences were not the same as a black person."}
{"title": "CMV: I believe when older comedians complain the younger generation is too politically correct, it\u2019s more that they don\u2019t understand our comedic sensibilities than that we really can\u2019t take a \u2018politically incorrect\u2019 joke.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3aal78", "selftext": "In the last year or so I\u2019ve seen at least three major comedians complain that the younger generations are politically correct to the point of stifling humor: Jerry Seinfeld, John Cleese, and Bill Maher. I think there are other people who were every bit as incorrect as those men but understood better what young people want from their comedy, and that indicates the problem is with the jokes, not the incorrectness.\n\nIn Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s recent complaint, he used the example of comparing people\u2019s use of cell phones to a gay French king (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/jerry-seinfeld-political-correctness_n_7552132.html). Maybe people hearing that joke would look particularly sour when he brought the homosexual stereotype into it, but I think that\u2019s because there wasn\u2019t really any humor there to justify it in the first place - talking about cell phone culture and people not seeming connected to each other is an incredibly stale topic, and I seriously doubt he would have gotten more of a laugh if he took the \u2018gay\u2019 part out of it.\n\nJohn Cleese appeared on Bill Maher\u2019s show (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCj6YNIpqmA) and complained that he could do jokes about some ethnicities/nationalities and not others - citing the example that he could say \u201cWhy are Australians so well-balanced? Because they have a chip on each shoulder\u201d but couldn\u2019t tell a Mexican joke. Again I think a lot of the issue there is that laughter at the Australian joke was already bordering on a sympathy laugh - it literally sounds more like something you\u2019d get out of a joke book than what you\u2019d expect from one of the lead members of Monty Python.\n\nAnd Maher is one of the worst - on a weekly basis, he delivers a monologue at the start of his show and inevitably makes a politically incorrect joke and complains that the audience doesn\u2019t laugh - but a lot of the rest of the monologue isn\u2019t that enthralling either, it\u2019s just that the audience is willing to be good sports as long as no one\u2019s being shit on.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other sources of comedy that I\u2019ve never seen someone in my generation take issue with, despite them completely ignoring political correctness. George Carlin would have been nearly eighty this year, and made points about abortion, religion, family, and government that were incredibly politically incorrect - but no one complained about it, because his points were novel, clever, and generally punched upward. Same thing with Dave Chappelle - he\u2019s in his forties, but his comedy is still fresh and hilarious to young people because he was saying things they hadn\u2019t heard before and was clearly doing it out of love. Danny DeVito is over seventy, and appears on the show Always Sunny in Philedelphia, which is horribly \u2018incorrect\u2019 - they\u2019ve made jokes regarding women, homosexuals, transexuals, Jews, Catholics, Muslims, the poor, the homeless, the mentally ill - and yet I\u2019ve never seen anyone from my generation take the slightest offense because the material is handled with a genuinely warm and ludicrous humor. Other shows like Weeds, Workaholics, South Park, and almost anything Seth MacFarlane worked on (a little overdone now, but we laughed when his shows were new) couldn\u2019t get through an episode without being wildly incorrect, yet it was rarely our generation that was taking issue with them.\n\nSo, if you feel the younger generation (say 30 and below) really has a problem seeing humor in the politically incorrect, now\u2019s your chance to argue for that.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people are describing this as a college-related issue. I only attended a semester of college and never got that involved in 'social justice' type conversations. Also, if it's specifically people being trained in how to think by the older generation who are taking offense, that's not really an argument the younger generation is the one with the problem. I'd say generally, with people I know, the only ways in which they seem less 'incorrect' than their parents are on genuine issues of racial and gender stereotypes.\n\nEDIT 2: OK, George Carlin nodded along when other people complained of political correctness to him. Having one more or one less person complaining about the topic really doesn't change the brunt of my argument - that there are plenty of incorrect things most of my generation will laugh it, they're just different things than the previous generation.\n\nFINAL EDIT: I'm starting to get arguments I've already responded to for the third of fourth time, so I'm going to head out for a while and if I see anyone really taking a different tack I'll respond to it when I come back."}

I am in full support of people living their lives as they please and transitioning if they please.I also believe that gender dysphoria is an innate trait related to hormones and genes like homosexuality/bisexuality.\n\n\nI had a discussion with one of my long time friends which was born with female genitalia and who identifies as male. This person often gets angry when people refer to him as \"she\" or a \"girl\"(this person looks female). To him, he is a male, a transgender male.\n\nNow,my understanding is that a transgender individual is one who doesn't identify as the sex they were assigned at birth.(Ex: feeling like you are a woman when you possess a penis and testicles)\n\nTo my friend being a man/male would basically be defined as the following.Personally, I found his definition circular,hence flawed, as it seemed he was using the very term he was trying to define within the definition.Man: Person who identifies as a man.\n\nThe arguments generally used against my stance of defining it according to sex organs are the grey areas one may encounter doing so, for example intersexed people.However, I'd argue a circular definition is worse than one with grey areas as it outright doesn't tell us what we're trying to define.Other responses seem to be that we ought to define according to neurology/psychology of individuals being more masculine/feminine, hence not using the \"X: Person who identifies as X\". However, I feel that a psychological portrait ( and hence neurological portrait) is going to generate a greater amount of grey areas than a general physiological one.I also don't understand why we would reject an account based on physiological properties like sex organs/hormones, but then use the brain instead which is a much more complex and less accessible system and hence harder to use for classification.\n\nDefinitions are not objective facts ,they are subjective association that we make between terms and concepts for the sole purpose mainly to facilitate discussion and communication. There is no logical reason \"a plane figure with four equal straight sides and four right angles.\" as to be the term \"square\" anymore then it has to be term \"carr\u00e9\".\n\nI personally agree with what somebody else said on the issue of definitions in general \"there are no good or bad definitions just useful ones\" which. A definition should be as clear as possible, we should favor definition which are less vague. A definition should not be circular as it doesn't really tell us anything, how could we understand the definition fully  when the whole reason we are looking at it is because we're unaware of the sense of one of it's components?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about the middle class, they aren't doing much that actually helps them.\n\nThe inflation: Middle class families used to live in 2-4 bedroom 1-2 bath bungalows in the suburbs or small towns. Quite often siblings would share a bedroom, there would be fights over who got to shower first because there was only one shower and a finite amount of hot water. You packed a sandwich for lunch, dad drove the one car the family owned and would own for the next 10 years to work and mom walked or took transit if available. Clothing was handed down to younger siblings or cousins, there was one modestly sized TV in the house, and when families got a computer it was for the entire family to share. Vacations where often to go camping somewhere which would involve tents and no electricity, not 50' trailers with full kitchens, bathrooms and wifi, and if you were to go on a trip to another country or something, it was something the family saved up for and didn't happen every year. If something was broken, you fixed it instead of throwing it out and buying three more. \n\nWhile all of that might sound like it came out of Leave it to Beaver or The Brady Bunch, I grew up in the 90's. \n\nNow, \"middle class\" people are shopping for luxury/designer brand clothing, cars, and other goods. It's practically considered child abuse to suggest that kids share a bedroom or don't have their own computer, tablet, and phone, and there is no way they would wear clothing handed down or two years old. Suburban/small town homes are multi level McMansions with granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, multiple big screen tvs, and master bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs and rain showers. The family car is two or three cars, potentially more if there kids old enough to drive at home, and instead of the kids going for a weekend at grandma's while the parents drive three hours away for a vacation where they stay in a motel and go out for a nice dinner, the whole family flies to an all inclusive resort in another country. \n\nYes, many of those things are cheaper than they once were, but many of them would have been considered luxuries or unattainable a generation ago and that would have been perfectly acceptable. Instead we lament the decline of the \"middle class\" while we continue to inflate what a middle class lifestyle is supposed to look like. \n\n**tl;dr the \"middle class\" is shrinking because what used to be defined as middle class would currently be considered below it, and what is currently \"middle\" class would have been upper-middle to \"rich\" in the past. Instead of lamenting the decline of the middle class we should reevaluate how we define it. CMV** \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: I support resources and help centers for male rape victims, but I don't see male rape as severe as female rape.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3a8arj", "selftext": "Hey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. \n\nThe reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's \"prey\" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. \n\nWhenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women.\n\nI guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. \n\nI really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone. Please tell my why I should *think* of male rape as bad as female rape. Again, I really want my view to change. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Pansexuality is a completely unnecessary term and not a legitimate sexuality", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3a8419", "selftext": "To start off, let\u2019s establish what pansexuality is. Googling the definition of pansexuality, we get **an individual not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity.** \n\nBecause the definition mentions both sex and gender, I think that it\u2019s important to acknowledge the difference. Sex is scientific. The only way that one can change their sex is undergoing an operation that would change their sexual organs to resemble the other sex\u2019s sexual organs. One cannot simply choose to identify as male or female\u2014 it is 100% genetic. Gender, on the other hand, is the whole of society\u2019s view on the attributes of that sex. For example, a very simple society might choose liking cars to be a \u201cman trait\u201d and liking flowers to be a \u201cwoman trait\u201d. This makes it very possible for a male to identify as a woman because he likes flowers vice versa. \n\nHowever, when discussing something such as sexuality (notice the sex part of the word), the concept of gender feels rather irrelevant. The term heterosexual, for example, is defined as someone who is attracted to the opposite sex. That\u2019s it. The term doesn\u2019t mention that the member of the opposite sex must like cars, flowers, males, females, or anything. A man that likes women with large breasts isn\u2019t a \u201cbreast-sexual\u201d. He is just a heterosexual who, just like almost everybody else, is slightly more complicated than loving every single woman he comes across.\n\nKeeping this in mind, there are only two sexes according to biologists: male and female. There are rare cases where an individual might have parts of both sexes, but a sex is always determined nonetheless. Thus, speaking to which sex an individual is attracted to, there are only four possible sexualities:\n\n1. Asexual \u2013 Attracted to neither sex\n2. Homosexual \u2013 Attracted to the same sex\n3. Heterosexual \u2013 Attracted to the opposite sex\n4. Bisexual \u2013 Attracted to both sexes\n\nThis is what makes the term \u201cpansexual\u201d so unnecessary. Since a pansexual does not care about a person\u2019s sex, they are attracted to both sexes. This makes them bisexual by definition. There is no need to add anything more to the word because sexuality is not meant to give a complete overview of what you find attractive. Otherwise, if people asked me my sexuality, I would say I am a brunette-female-who-is-shorter-than-me-but-not-too-short-and-has-a-good-sense-of-humor-as-well-as-an-appreciation-for-science-and-has-an-attractive-looking-face-sexual, which is absolutely ridiculous.\r\r**TL;DR: Pansexuality is just a subset of bisexuality. This makes it an unnecessary term since almost all attraction is a subset of sexuality (I.e. A heterosexual male who only likes blondes) and we could not possibly give a term to each.**\n\n\n_____\n\n&amp;gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: 51 \"New\" Gender Options are Over-the-Top and Useless.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3a7ys8", "selftext": "Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am *not* against anyone in the LGBT community and welcome the idea of gay marriage and things similar. However, I've never really been on-board with all these new genders. \n\nAnyway, some of the terms that come to mind are *Agender* and *Androgynous*. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words? *Genderfluid* and *Bigender* seem completely redundant too - so, why even have them? I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth. \n\nDoes it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as *gender-fluid* because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than *cross-dressing*. Again, I have nothing against that, but it seems like people are trying to make other words to someone glorify what they're doing.\n\nAlso, what's the deal with \"cis\"?\n\n* Cis-female.\n* Cis-male.\n* Cis-man.\n* Cis-woman.\n* Cisgender.\n\nIf the definition of \"cis\" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they *just* be called women and men? Why do they have to have a special name? Considering that people are giving away names to things that already exist, it seems really indicative of how strong other words in their dictionary are (see: gender-fluid and bi-gender redundancy).\n\nAgain, I can't stress this enough, I have no issues with people being who they want to be and how they want to be that. It just seems overly unnecessary to have a million new Facebook gender options for things that clearly overlap each-other. A lot of this also seems more of a ploy for attention, not someone *actually* identifying as something.\n\nWith that being said, am I just seeing this the wrong way? I get incredibly annoyed when someone tells me they're \"gender-fluid\" or \"cis-female\". It makes me believe that I may be seeing this the wrong way - or maybe these terms really are inessential and pointless?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't have any qualms about swatting flies, and I also recognise the need for pest control.

{"title": "CMV: Religion as a whole does not need to be abolished.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3a5li5", "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I'm an atheist.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me explain my view. [Many people on CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/general#wiki_against_religion) have expressed views that religion is harmful to society and has stopped the advancement of science in society. Common examples are used such as killings and wars that have took place on the premise of religion.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that religion as a whole needs to be abolished. While I feel that certain fundamentalist views need to be abolished, in general most religious people do not engage in such activities, and instead seek to carry out the values of peace, love, etc. that keeps a society together. I think that as long as religion is kept a personal matter, it is alright for religion to exist.\n\nBy \"personal matter\" I mean that people should not engage actively to uphold their own form of morality, and instead follow the rules that keep a community together. For example, while Christians may be against homosexual rights, they should not engage in activity that discriminates against homosexuals or support anti-homosexual policies, but instead advocate against homosexuality on a moral basis. This is under the assumption that homosexuality does not cause any harm to society, which I will not discuss further.\n\nAssuming that people do abide by these conditions, I see no reason why religion would cause harm to society. CMV.\n\n---\n\n**Clarifications (will update as time passes):**\n\n1. By personal matter, I make an exception for the spreading of ideas (such as discussing religion with your children or converting others). The crux is that your actions must not harm others.\n\n2. I'm proposing that by keeping religion as a \"personal matter\", most harm will be curbed.\n\n---\n\n**List of common arguments (will update as time passes):**\n\n**A** stands for argument, **CA** stands for counterargument.\n\n**A:** Publicly endorsing beliefs that are not supported by strong scientific evidence can be seen as causing harm to society and slowing down progress.\n\n**CA:** I do not think that publicly endorsing religion will cause a significant effect. People are already inclined to believe many things that are not supported by strong scientific evidence. For example, superstitions, pseudoscience, stuff on the internet on sites such as *cough* Reddit *cough*, and much more.\n\n**A: ** Particular parts of religion clash with science. You are either forced to continually change and amend all religions to keep in line with the current scientific world view, or you are telling people to choose religion over science, harming scientific advance.\n\n**CA: ** I'd opt for letting people decide, since it is impossible to amend all religions to keep in line with science. This will definitely harm scientific advance. *[to be completed when I sort out my thoughts]*\n\n---\n\nAfter spending an hour, I couldn't think of a counterargument to the above arguments. I've awarded the deltas. Thanks for changing my view, /r/changemyview!\n\nI will try to come up with a modified solution and see if that works out.

CMV.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3a5e7a", "selftext": "I have been thinking a lot about the ACA and recently watched the Last Week Tonight on the Hobby Lobby case which I disagreed quite a bit with. It brought up a lot of thoughts about what I think about the interaction between business, employees and government.\n\nSo my basic presumption is that your job is not a right, because if you do your job poorly your employer should have the ability to find a better employee (feel free to CMV here). Thus, the associated benefits associated with your job (read: heath insurance but also including pensions, paid vacation, etc.) are not duties to be provided by the employer, but rather *benefits* to incentivize better employees to work for that business.\n\nIt mostly stems from the idea that even if just theoretically, the basis of the Hobby Lobby case could dis-incentivize business. Say for example Hobby Lobby had lost its case in the Supreme Court. If the owners of the company were truly opposed to providing whatever certain contraception they had been forced to provide, they would close their doors or sell their company. Should this be an acceptable potential outcome?\n\nPlease be aware, I am NOT saying that health care is not a right (nor that employers do not have duties to their employees). I am saying it is not a duty of an employer to provide insurance or for a law to state employers must provide it. Rather health insurance should be, in regard to an employer, a benefit that should incentivize the type of employee to apply at the company. If a company didn't find they were getting enough, or skilled enough employees, the company could choose to alter its considerations and provide things they would not have otherwise. This puts the decision clearly in the hands of the company (and the market for labor). A universal healthcare could be provided by the government, and taxed for. \n\nFeel free to address the statements like \"My boss shouldn't control what I do with my body.\" It seems a bit exclusive. I hear \"provide me additional benefits at your cost but if it isn't to my liking I would still rather keep this job and blame you for providing me more than pay but not enough stuff instead of taking my skills elsewhere.\"\n\nI've been awake for a long time so I probably could've formatted this better but I think most of my thoughts are here. Is a job a right? Is employment as a general whole a right but not any specific job? Is it a duty for an employer to provide benefits like insurance, retirement plans/pensions, vacation etc. Am I incorrect that it could provide negative incentives to business? \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I think it's a selfish motive to purposely try to have children.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3a44py", "selftext": "I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids. \nHere's a few reasons why I find it selfish.\n\n1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.\n\n2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.\n\n3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the \"right\" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it. \n\n\nHonestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: \"Love\" and \"Hate\" are both irrational emotions sitting on extreme ends of the very same spectrum. Both are dangerous to feel.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3a3nn7", "selftext": "**Context:** As I've been re-organize how I view the world lately, my very conception of Love has come under fire. When dealing with emotionally lofty concepts such as love and hate, things can get messy and abstract. Additionally, these are both words that are used in many different ways, but I am positing a specific semantic distinction that I feel applies to both Love and Hate. The mild caveat is that because people hyperbolize both words, they have lost some meaning colloquially, but if you conceptualize \"Love\" as romantic love or the feeling of being \"In Love\", it may be easier.\n \n \n**Argument:** Both love and hate are on the same spectrum of a type of emotion. They are the very opposite extremes to an emotion that is felt by a human being so strongly that it actually destroys that person's ability to make rational, controlled, and logical decision making.\n \n**Hate** is a little easier to understand, and I certainly contest that it\u2019s an irrational emotion. Hate is experiencing feelings so negative and upsetting that one is unable to think rationally about the concept. If one hates a concept, a person, or a thing, and I mean *actually* hates \u2013 not just hyperbolic expression \u2013 then that person is undercutting even understanding their own reason for feeling the way they are. A person who hates a concept isn\u2019t even willing, interested, or capable of thinking in a level-headed way about that concept. Stubbornness, blindness, willful ignorance or what have you, hate destroys the ability to reason. I\u2019d contest that due to this, hate is never worthwhile and should never be applied to anything or anyone. There isn\u2019t a singular concept, person, or thing that one should hate. Hitler, pedophiles, racism, malaria, or hot-pockets, actual hatred towards anything seems to imply a misunderstanding of the thing.\n \n**Love**, on the other hand, is when you have emotions so positive about a person, place, or thing that the person who \"loves\" it cannot actually think rationally about that thing. That person is so caught up in the emotions that the ability to weigh out other perspectives, to reason in a different way, or to think objectively about that thing is quite literally disabled. In this way people often talk about romantic love. People may debate that experiencing love is obviously positive, and it brings about so many beautiful expressions\u2026 yet it can also lead to de-prioritizing important life events, self-survival, and contemplation of one\u2019s situation. It's very, very rare to have someone so emotionally impacted over an object, however. One example might be Bruce Willis\u2019s character Butch Coolidge in Pulp Fiction, who risks his life to retrieve a watch with significant sentimental value.\n\n\nThe true essence of experiencing love for someone or being in love, is then an emotion that simply disallows rational thought. It, like hate, has an inherent risk. While some desire this type of expression, it can be very unsettling and even dangerous to human beings.\n\n\nAs such, I believe both hate and love are on the same continuum. The actual expression of these emotions (and not merely semantic expression) is borderline unwanted. However, because the emotions that lead to those ends of the continuum are easy to quantify (happiness, pleasure, comfort vs anger, fear, disgust) one seems more appealing than the other.\n\n\n**Semantic Usage:** I don\u2019t believe that I am suggesting that no one should use these terms, because hyperbolic statements and exaggeration are natural to humans. I do believe that maybe, just maybe, there are better terms to express our unyielding, overwhelming expressions of positivity and negativity. It\u2019s certainly healthier to identify a conscious dismantling of the thing one \u201chates\u201d and advocate against it, logically and with supporting evidence. And it almost seems much sweeter to identify to a partner that your feelings come from a place of reasoned, mindful, and intentional consideration\u2026 and not just mere gut feelings.\n\n**Considerations:** Do y'all think that Love and Hate are rational emotional expressions? Are there times that it's beneficial to a person to feel irrational? If so, then maybe Love and Hate aren't dangerous to experience all the time. Is my underlying assumption that irrationality is dangerous also wrong? When is it ok, and more specifically, when is experiencing Hate as I define it ok? \n \n**TL;DR:** Love and Hate both sit on the same spectrum of emotions. They are defined by emotions so strong that one actually is unable to think rationally when experiencing them. I contest that these are both dangerous emotions because irrationality is dangerous to a human being.\n_____\n \n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I would prefer to call this a non-revealing headline, as \u201cClickbait\u201d has a negative connotation, but we can call it clickbait if you like.\n\nA non-revealing headline leads people to follow the link and view the content. If a headline is too revealing, people will just read the title and move on without even reading the article. This is detrimental to the spread of information because people will assume that their surface knowledge of the title is enough to know the content of the article, and they will miss too much important information. \n\nIf the content and substance of an article could be expressed with a single phrase, there would be no need for articles. To try and express the content of an article with one headline is an insult to the article itself because it suggests there is only one phrase of meaningful content in the article. Paraphrasing and summarizing can be useful, but that does not imply that they aid in the titling of an article. They are better suited in the conclusion, and possibly the introduction of an article.\n\nThe following arguments do not effectively apply against \u201cclickbait\u201d:\n\n1) Clickbait is just used to make money, so it\u2019s an insult to \u2018real\u2019 news.\n\nA vast majority of news is published by companies for profit. Thus, the titling method is irrelevant.\n\n2) Clickbait is used to link to malware and spread viruses.\n\nAnything imaginable on the internet can and has been used to spread malware.\n\n3) Clickbait is sensationalism, which is bad. \n\nWhether or not sensationalism is bad is an entirely different argument altogether (Let\u2019s not have it here). Much of modern news is sensationalism, so it changes nothing. Also, an intriguing headline is not necessarily a sensationalized one. \n\nEdit: To fix some confusion:\n\n \"Officer pulls over black woman, you won't believe what happens next!\" is okay (this is what i mean by clickbait).\n\n \"Officer pulls over black woman and changes her tire\" is fine, but less people will actually read the article. \n\n\"Black woman changes heart of officer who pulls her over\" would be misleading and wrong.

Im not in med school yet either like the rest of my Indian family and friends, instead I got a research associate position at a med school doing cardiology research making a measley 35K a year before tax.  So its not like I have money or med school status either.\n\nPlease help me change my view that these negative beliefs aren't deal breakers for dating attractive women and that there are attractive women out there who are willing to see past all that.\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for all of the uplifting responses and the tough love!  I guess that's what I needed.  Although I know that I do in fact need to be more confident and believe in myself more, you need to have the necessary ingredients for that to happen, such as money and career success.  As someone who doesn't have much going for him, how can you just be confident when you have no reason to be confident?  \n\nEDIT 2:  Thanks to all for your responses.  I know I have a long way to go and its going to be a tough road with lots of failure ahead.  But I'll try my best to keep going because I want to change myself and become the confident, fun, sexy man that I know I am.  All of your comments have helped to change my view \u2206.  Thanks a lot!"}

This should not be restricted to the terminally ill - anybody should be free to make the choice for themselves. Some people decide that they just don't want to be here any more, and society should accept that.\n\nCurrently, society takes every possible action to prevent people from taking their own lives - e.g. placing tight restrictions on certain substances/items, forcibly detaining &amp; \"treating\" people who appear to be \"at risk\" to themselves, even basic discussion of suicide methods is banned here on Reddit and elsewhere. There is a mantra of \"Saving lives at all costs\" - even if the cost is the person's own well-being &amp; freedom. We place far too much emphasis on extending people's lives as much as possible but almost none on actually doing anything to improve them.\n\nThis leads to a number of problems - some people are afraid to talk about their problems and seek help for fear of being forcibly detained, or have restrictions placed on them (such as being unable to buy firearms, for example). Someone who has simply decided that they have had enough and just don't want to continue won't be able to discuss their feelings with anyone due to the fear of being labelled \"mentally ill\" and sectioned.\n\nPeople who are unable to access a painless and \"mess free\" method still take their own lives anyway - often resulting in public, gruesome suicides that affect others (jumping in front of trains, for example) or failed attempts that could leave them in a vegetative state.\n\n\"Suicide on the State\" would solve a lot of these problems. People could be more frank about their feelings. Public suicides would be a lot less common. It would far less of a shock to loved ones - they'd get notice, and the person would have the chance to get their affairs in order before their departure - giving notice to their employer, for example.

But I also understand that this is just a belief. There's no data set, equation, or natural observation that can prove certain deeds are wrong on a metaphysical level. \n\n\nAre morals are completely created by the natural world. Starting with physics and how we came to be leading to biology with its principle of evolution. Much of what we believe is right in wrong has to do with what gave the best chance at extending an organisms genetic line. If an action is harmful to the completion of this goal, then the organisms less inclined to do so will more likely have its genetie materiel passed on. This works similarly with cultures. The groups of people that take on attitudes and beliefs that make a culture more invasive and enduring will be the ones to set the moral code. Furthermore, just as there is genetic drift in biology there are traits in a cultures moral code that spontaneously came to be.\n\n\nI know that all the various feelings i have on determining right or wrong fall apart when looked at objectively. Any thought of love, empathy, duty, honor, fear, or horror are just the axons and neurons firing in our brain. For simplicity's sake \"just because\" is the only valid argument for our moral codes. When I really step back and look at the most infamous figures in history and their most villainous acts I see that their evilness is manufactured by society. Those who lack certain required traits are labeled as psychopaths and narcissists.\n\n\nAll this said I am cultured to believe in moral principals  just as much as the next person. I don't advocate for  an anarchic society, as that would bring much less pleasure to myself. But I do find the inability of many people to except this principle annoying. They make it difficult to discuss issues involving humanity and its definition. The reddit community for all its merits is particularly confounding for its violent and antagonistic vitriol in response to those who are anti-gay, pro-choice, and those who enjoy harassing others for entertainment value. One issue that I struggle with in particular is animal cruelty. For better or worse I don't feel any major sense of empathy when I hear about an animal being \"brutally\" treated or killed. In reaction I simply act horrified so as not to be burned at the stake while secretly I wonder in confusion at other's outrage.\n\n\n**tldr; There is no right or wrong, just what you believe is right or wrong.**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They need to constantly be held accountable and should never be beyond reproach\n\n&gt;&gt;You say the proper venue to challenge the police's legal right to do something is in the courts; I say the proper venue is any and everywhere.\n\nI do believe this but reading it back to myself and trying to see it from someone else point of view I feel like I sound like some kind of deluded government conspiracy theorist.\n\nEDIT: It's been pointed out that my title is shitty and misleading. I'll restate my position better but as of now I no longer hold that view specifically.\n\nCops have authority. I fully support that. I believe it's necessary for a society to function for there to be people to enforce the law by means greater than what the average citizen should be allowed.\n\nI also believe those enforcers should be held to a higher moral standard. That they should not violate the reach of the powers we give them. And that if they do, we, the very people that gave them the power in the first place, have our own duty to not allow it despite such disobedience being an often unsafe and likely consequential undertaking.\n\nMight doesn't make right. I definitely don't want to get my ass beat and/or thrown in jail for pissing off the wrong cop by not letting him violate my rights and despite my position I don't know if I would have the courage in the moment to stand up to a weaponized bully but I do know it would be the right thing to do. Maybe not the smart thing, but the right thing.\n\nI'm not saying to go around saying the fuck the police and disobeying them for no reason.

While the possibility exists for neglect or abuse on the owner's part, we say that those downsides aren't enough to find the practice in general morally objectionable.\n\nSuppose we encountered an alien race whose intelligence as can be determined via every measure is greater than ours by a factor equal to the factor between humans and dogs/cats. (Ex: If humans are 10x smarter than dogs, these aliens would be 10x smarter than humans, and 100x smarter than dogs.) When it comes to communication, their culture and society is so hopelessly complex and nuanced that we'll never be able to communicate with them as they do with each other. At best the aliens may attempt to speak to us using signals we can comprehend. (Just as humans attempt to do with pets.)\n\nSuppose also that the general attitude towards pet keeping with these aliens is the same as our attitude. Humans should given food and shelter to satisfy all their physical needs, and humans should be given enough freedom so that they can exercise most of their physical, intellectual, and creative desires. Emotionally, the primary bond a human can expect is of companionship with it's owner, but it's possible that they will be able to interact and form strong bonds with other pets. Of course, these things are no more *guaranteed* to happen then they are with humans and their pets, but the aliens feel that their standard of care is strong enough that those concerns don't necessitate outlawing pet keeping, or finding pet keeping in general morally objectionable.\n\nOn the whole, I believe this would be a beneficial relationship for humanity, to the same degree that the pet-owner relationship humans have with dogs/cats is beneficial for those dogs/cats.\n\n*One final disclaimer: There are many different kinds of pets humans have, that posses many different levels and kinds of intelligence. Fish obviously don't generally receive the same standard of care and freedom as dogs do. I'd like to keep the discussion focused on animals that we treat similarly to dogs and cats. I've focused so much on dogs and cats because they're A) very, very common as pets. B) pretty dang smart, but still nowhere near us.

{"title": "CMV: If brothels were legal then the 'by-the-book' strip clubs would go out of business.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_39y3l4", "selftext": "Admittedly Strip Clubs have come to be seen as a fun and even ideal environment for partying. The 'by-the-book' clubs don't allow clients to have sex with the strippers, though of course it most likely happens a lot and many strippers are prostitutes, but not all. The two jobs aren't all that dissimilar (sex work), though stripping is more of an art and I imagine the best performers take it quite seriously and don't sell themselves (cheaply).\n\nOn the client side, I think the only reason strip clubs came to be is due to a crackdown on 'out in the open' brothels and the type of men who would go to a strip club would also go to a brothel if they didn't feel like criminals. If brothels were legalized I can see some of those businesses eventually reaching a similar level of social acceptance, thus brothels will become more than a series of dark rooms full of sex-slaves and may become the amusing harems and menageries of historical fiction. \n\nI find that not only will clients prefer the legal brothel with a nice entertainment budget. Why just go watch a girl dance around naked? Why not touch her as you like and even have sex? Or watch people have sex etc. The type of men who regularly go to strip clubs most likely only go because they cant get attractive women to pay attention to them and are willing to deal with teasing and stripping because an illegal brothel can result in infections or jail time. \n\nI even suspect that the performers will end up working in brothels rather than strip clubs. Seeing as there are women who will have sex with them without legal repercussions men won't throw as much money at a girl who is just taking her clothes off. No doubt brothels will end up having some of the girls strip to entice clients to go into the back rooms with them. The artistic side of stripping, which only exists due to the illegality of brothels and male willingness to throw money at attractive women, will lose a great deal of funding and talent. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land.\n\n* Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis.\n\nThe reason I want to abolish rent regulations in NYC is that it drastically reduces the available housing supply and harms people looking to move to or within the city.  Anyone who has won the rent regulation lottery never moves out, and you end up with a highly inefficient allocation of apartments within the city.\n\nIt also hugely depresses the creation of new rental units within the city, because new landlords see what happened to old landlords who got stuck with controlled units.\n\nI don't think there should be a property right in a rental.  If you want a property interest in the place where you live, you should buy it.  If you're renting, you should be subject to the market forces that come with that.\n\n**Edit 1:**  I was hoping to get some replies before I had to step away, but so far it's just crickets.  Will be away from computer for about an hour and a half or so, and will reply when I'm back.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot](http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/02/22/fantastic-four-why-casting-a-black-actor-as-the-human-torch-might-make-a-better-movie/), and the casting of [Emma Stone as Allison Ng in *Aloha*](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/03/entertainment/cameron-crowe-emma-stone-aloha-apology-feat/). Now, I know both of these examples aren't perfect opposites, but the reception has been wildly different. When Michael B. Jordan was cast as the new Human Torch, people were thrilled. Despite the Human Torch [never once being black in the comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch), people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting \"culturally insensitive,\" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her \"unlikely heritage,\" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 1/4 Chinese heritage.\n\nI don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor \"insensitive?\"\n\nI'd love to hear other thoughts. I've only seen these two issues (minority casting of white roles and white casting of minority roles) tackled separately.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

One of the top posts in /r/all right now is this: \n\n&gt;Hey Reddit Board Members, if Redditors can push a stupid button for 2 months straight you better believe we can keep Reddit \"unsafe\" for as long as it takes to replace Ellen Pao\n\nI don't think those people are really thinking this through, and it will ultimately prove to be a waste of time. Board members aren't going to look at a bunch of people (most of whom are upset because their hatred of people has been censored) calling the CEO a cunt and say, \"Boy they're making a mess of things. We'd best give them what they want.\" A far more likely scenario is, \"We don't want those assholes on our site anyway.

The two subs (that weren't direct responses to this whole incident) that seem to be the most outraged are /r/KotakuinAction (41,000) and /r/conspiracy (313,000).

I don't think anyone is going to sweat that, especially when most of the site (even those who decry the censorship) didn't like /r/fatpeoplehate to begin with. I think at most one million people ultimately leave Reddit for Voat, and I don't think that number is nearly high enough for any of the higher ups to care.\n\nSo ultimately, I think all this outrage will prove fruitless and nothing will come of any of this.

He asked why, justifying his reasoning that if I support the Men's side, that the Women's side require just as much support from me in order to grow the sport for both sexes. \n\nWhile I am all for growing the sport of football/soccer in the United States, I just cannot care if the sport has success on the women's side. My simply reasoning is that the women's side of the sport is every way, shape and form, inferior to the men's side. To back up this, the USWNT was torched in a friendly in 2012 by the US Men's U-17 side with the final score being 8-2 (see more info here: http://forums.bigsoccer.com/threads/uswnt-vs-u-17-usmnt.1939180/). On the other token, I have quite a bit of interest in our U-17 and U-20 side, knowing that we have coaches raising these players with the potential of making the main side that competes in the Gold Cup and the FIFA World Cup. \n\nI am by no means saying that young girls shouldn't go out to watch the Womens World Cup if they feel compelled to. I do know that positive, quality, female role models in the sport, or rather in any field, are needed in this day and age. However, watching women play the sport is not entertaining or interesting to me.\n\nCMV\n\nEDIT 1: I apologize for the late responses; lets just say life takes some interesting turns...\n\nEDIT 2: I think some people are taking my argument as if I am not supporting the USWNT. It's anything but. If they win the World Cup, then great, it'll help the sport out greatly domestically, and it'll be another feather in US Soccer Federation's cap. I just prefer, and thus has an interest, in the men's side of the sport. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: The United States lost World War II", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_39o24x", "selftext": "I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.\n\nI am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.\n\nContrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.\n\nWhat really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?\n\nSorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

However, I think that much of the current anti-abortion stance is more about punishing sexually active women than about protecting unborn children.  I believe this because many or most of the people who are against abortion simultaneously hold the point of view that access to birth control and aid to poor families should be reduced or eliminated, and maternity leave (or lack thereof) should be left up to employers.   Birth control prevents pregnancy, and free or reduced birth control goes a long ways to prevent unwanted pregnancy and subsequent abortions.  Paid maternity leave helps new mothers and their babies bond, heal and generally get a good start.  Aid to poor families provides a basic safety net to keep young families from going hungry or homeless.  The knowledge of a basic safety net would encourage those who become pregnant unintentionally from aborting due to financial pressure.\n\nI find it disingenuous that many of those who claim to be in favor of protecting the unborn are against the very policies that make life easier for young families.  I think by simultaneously holding the views against abortion, birth control, paid maternity leave, and aid to families one is displaying that they care more about punishing sexually active women, and by extension their children, by creating a situation that virtually ensures a live of struggle for those women who do not have a supportive partner.\n\nI am not sure what would change my mind, but I am a reasonable and logical person.  If it can be demonstrated to me how individuals who simultaneously hold the views that I described can truly interested in the well-being of the unplanned fetus and the person it will eventually and the family unit in general become I am open to changing my mind.\n\n------------\nEdit: I have changed my view.  I no longer think that punishing sexually active women is the main point of the anti-abortion movement.  The disconnect between anti-abortion beliefs and the lack of desire for policies to support young women/mothers are coincidentally held by many people, but the second belief does not mean that people are insincere about their belief in the first.  Perhaps illogical, but not insincere.\n\nNote that this does not change my point of view of being pro-choice, which is based on a belief that an embryo/fetus is a potential human, but not an actual human early in development and that choices should be left between women and their doctors.  Nor does it change my option that improved policies to support reducing the cost of birth control and providing aid to families in need would be effective in reducing the number of abortions.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But so does the current system for those who want to avoid the down-side unemployment and no long-term relief from student loans. \n\nA system of \"shares\" would likely also discourage investors from paying for worthless online degrees, or college amenities that do not advance future earnings. \n\nThis is a relatively new concept for me, so I'm eager to hear from those who want to change my view, or at least help me refine my understanding of the trade-offs.  Thanks for weighing in!\n\nEdit #1: Thanks for all the great comments and arguments so far.  One delta awarded at this point to /u/PlexiglassPelican for suggesting it makes better sense to have the payment based on a percentage of income beyond a basic amount that would have come even without a degree.  (/u/ngxp has also convincingly argued that existing banks would not likely be the ones to enter this new format, but that doesn't persuade me the format is a bad idea.  I think maybe formulaic, risk-averse banks *should* take a back seat in this arena.)\n\nEdit #2: Whoa!  So many great comments and thoughts.  Many here are presuming (as I admit I did when I first started the thread) that what major you choose would likely be a key factor for investors deciding who to fund.  And so many people here are assuming that a share system would be the death of the liberal arts.  Although no one has really argued to the contrary, I now think this is a misplaced emphasis.  Although it is not central to my view, I'm inclined to think that getting a degree in any major at an ivy league school vs. any major at a local community college is going to be a bigger factor than your major choice within a given school.   Also, the share system doesn't have to be a fixed percentage (though probably there is a natural maximum at the point it starts to discourage seeking work).  Finally (and relatedly), getting a degree in something doesn't mean that you are compelled to work in that field.  So getting an English degree from a second-rate university might wind up costing, say 12% of your earnings (above a certain threshold -- see edit #1) for the next 30 years, while getting a Math degree from Stanford might wind up costing 3% of your earnings.  \n\nEdit #3:  Thanks to all who participated in this spirited discussion.  I'm going to wrap this up with a final delta to /u/hacksoncode who made clear to me that those who marry and have a spouse support them after college would need to be prepared to commit a portion of their joint income to repay the investor.  Most of the rest of the comments at this point seem to be covering the same ground, which I have not found persuasive in my view that the proposed system is better than the student loan system:\n\n* Investors would find this product more risky than loans, and so it would not fit the business model of banks\n* Stupid people would no longer be able to, literally, mortgage their future to \"dream\" unrealistically\n* Direct taxpayer funding of college might be better than either system.\n* This deal would be better for some people than for others.  For those who wind up making higher incomes, it would on average be a worse deal than existing student loans, for those who wind up making lower incomes it would on average be a better deal.\n\nEven if I agreed with these things, and mostly I do, they would not change my view.  Finally, there has been a lot of discussion premised (and I was guilty of this too, at first) on the notion that your field of study would be a major driver for attracting investors.  I'm coming around to the view that except in the case of very specialized programs (e.g. engineering, medicine), field of study won't be as big a factor as student achievement and quality of school overall. \n\nFrom this point forward, I may not respond to all (or any) further responses, except if I feel they are really adding something new.  Nonetheless, I hope the discussion continues with others participating as desired!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The movies were better, the television was better, the music was *way* better, the toys &amp; games were far superior to what exists now, and the day to day experience was better. Back then, social behavior took place in person, not on a computer/mobile screen. We hung out in malls and arcades, we played outside, we actually *did* things instead of posting things. When we went to concerts, we actually watched the concerts live, and not through our phones. \n\nNow I know that the two biggest arguments people are going to make are technology and the Internet:\n\n\n**Internet**: Yes, as an adult, the Internet is great, but for kids, I would argue that it's a negative; just one more potential danger for kids to contend with. You ask anyone over 30 if they would've wanted someone filming/posting the crazy shit they did as a kid. This first generation of kids growing up on Social Media is going to be haunted by every stupid post, every bad picture, every idiotic idea, for the rest of their lives. No thanks.\n\n**Technology**:  Again, yes, the tech is much better now than it was back then, but back then, we got far more enjoyment out of our tech than kids do now. For us, the NES was every bit as amazing as the Xbox One and PS4 are now, and we enjoyed them just as much, if not more.  \n\nKids today are under far more pressure and stress, from far more sources, than we ever were, and because of that, I say, being a kid now sucks compared to being a kid back then. If you want to CMV, convince me that, the overall experience of kids today is better than it was 30 years ago.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**EDIT**: Comparisons of technology between then and now are irrelevant. Yes, the effects in movies are better today, and yes, video games have better graphics today, but only by today's standards, which didn't exist back then.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I had to use every ounce of my willpower to prevent myself from fighting back. Whenever I was bullied, I would scream at the bullies. The teachers told me that it was my own fault that I was being bullied because of the way I screamed at them. I tried to tell them that screaming was a reflex which I physically couldn't control, but they just kept telling me that it was my own fault. For years, I had to hold in all of my anger because I knew that if I fought back I would be suspended. It was holding in all that anger which led to a suicide attempt. This was a long time ago, so I'm better now. However, the reason why victims of bullying commit suicide is because no one takes them seriously. No matter how minor the bullying is, a person should never be told to ignore it, and certainly never told that it's their own fault. It is the very definition of victim blaming and should not be done. I'm sure some of the comments will say that they only bullied me to get a reaction, so if I didn't scream at them they would have stopped bullying me. However, saying that is victim blaming, no matter how true it is. I would also like to point out that screaming is a natural reaction to fear, and that I was using all of my willpower to prevent myself from fight back. If the school will not allow kids to fight back, than the school should do something about the bullying. If I could have fought back without being suspended, than I would have. My school has a policy that all kids involved in a fight are suspended. In my school, kids given out-of-school suspension are forced to go to an \"Alternative Learning Center\" for the duration of their suspension. I knew that if I was suspended I would be sent their, and that it was filled with bad kids who would have been far worse than the bullies at the school.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This change happened before anyone had commented and was not from a user of CMV, thus I have not awarded a delta for this.\n\nIf personal identity is not its naturally-occurring exterior origins, but generated by the self, and a person transforms themselves physically or mentally or in other ways to realise externally what their identity is internally, then we should treat their proclaimed identity as legitimate. Perhaps the only way we could reasonably challenge someone's identity is by knowing what they know about themselves, which - empirically and strictly speaking - is impossible. Given this, and barring obvious dishonest representations by a person, i.e. where it is clear that their motives for the transformation or holding a new identity are ulterior, we should respect the proclaimed identities of Caitlyn Jenner and Rachel Dolezal.\n\nI do not think that this argument extends outside of personal identity, since if someone identifies themselves as a 'writer' and they are in fact a doctor who only writes prescriptions, it is reasonable for me to rejection their proclamation of a professional identity which they are obviously not, since I can externally realise this without or in spite of their internal 'knowledge' which is the basis of their proclamation, i.e. their professional identity arises from their testable actions.\n\n**EDIT ADDITION:** A similar (implied) point was made by a Facebook user on a post by the Washington Post, and another commented with [this](https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost/posts/10153031577997293?comment_id=10153031580157293&amp;reply_comment_id=10153031893797293&amp;total_comments=84&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D): \"Huge difference is that Caitlin has been HONEST about said transition. This woman has a history of lies, said someone else was her father, etc. Caitlin didn't do any of those things.\"\n\nI agree this is a huge difference, and perhaps a big enough difference for us to question Rachel Dolezal's motives and whether they were ulterior to her proclaimed internal personal identity. In fact, I would go so far as to say this changes my view in example but not principle, i.e. Rachelo Dolezal is probably not an example of someone who truly had an internal personal identity of being African-American, but instead had ulterior motives. MV in principle remains unaltered, however.\n\n**META discussion re (now reversed) removal** can be discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasforcmv/comments/39np29/rule_e_should_be_extended_from_3_to_24_hours/).\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the English language, where words can mean different things in different contexts. And this isn't just a colloquialism, where people have misused the term gender to the point where it has become commonplace. This is used all the time in biology to describe sex in species other than humans. See [this paper](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roberto_Tognetti/publication/233384891_Adaptation_to_climate_change_of_dioecious_plants_does_gender_balance_matter/links/09e4150ea89dc9eab9000000.pdf) on dioecious plant species. \nWe even have a term in biology called [gender load](http://www.uoguelph.ca/~amclab/amclab/Publications_files/Svensson.EA.09.pdf) to describe a phenomena where there is a  continuous production of low-fitness offspring of\nboth sexes. If you are concerned that someone might not understand what they are talking about, use what I just laid out as a correction. Tell them they are confusing identity or social construct and biological sex. In the same way that you might tell someone opposed to gay rights that when you\u2019re talking about marriage you are referring only to the legal contract between spouses and not what they think their god says. \n\nFurthermore, [an etymology search]( http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=gender&amp;searchmode=none) of the word gender reveals that the word has long been used interchangeably with sex. \nSo, tell me reddit.

The admins seem to be acting as though these related subreddits are a form of ban evasion, and most people seem to agree. Meanwhile, the claim continues to be that they are only banning rule breakers, not censoring ideas.\n\nWhat disturbs me about this is that **there is no such thing as subreddit ban evasion.**\n\nA subreddit is not a person, it is a topic of conversation. If, after a particular subreddit is banned for breaking the rules, people go on to set up new subreddits with the same topic of conversation... shouldn't that subreddit have the same opportunity to follow the rules as any other? If those mods can do a better job, shouldn't they get the chance?\n\nOn the other hand, if simply setting up a new subreddit for the same topic is treated as ban evasion, and immediately banned as well, then isn't that exactly equivalent to *banning the topic?* If the admins are banning all subreddits for a particular topic of conversation, a particular idea, and for no other reason then being for that topic, being that idea... then isn't that objectively the banning of the idea?\n\nI am very disturbed at the thought that all those folks crying censorship might actually be right this time, and even more so at the thought that the admins might actually be lying to us.

Another factor is the cuteness of the animal (I have a soft spot for snakes and insects so I notice this)-- The popular, often almost gleeful, condemnation some of these activities is inseparable from hatred of outsiders and the oppressed.\n\nFor those who cherish animal life in a less arbitrary way it could seem like, this blood-thirsty mob has, for once taken, the correct side. But, this is an illusion-- we are are harmed by the inconsistency and emotion-driven fervor of these people who would suggest hanging as punishment for dog fights, then blithely eat chicken from a large producer, or smile at photos of their uncle posed with half-dead and suffocating sword fish.\n\nI think there are important questions here, I don't have the answers either. My point is not that all of these actions are equivalent, but rather that they have more in common than many people care to acknowledge. I would not be sad to live in a meatless, leather-free future, it might make me feel old, like someone's homophobic grandma who tries, but can't quite shake deeply learned prejudice. But, I think we have no choice but to recognize the cruelty in our own culture as, at least, similar to the cruelty found in other cultures. Most people I know personally who care about these issues already think about this rather deeply, so my criticisms are not for them. Many animal rights activists *do* see the parallels but it is hard to hear their intelligent arguments over the din consisting of little but mad-vitriol over certain animals (especially dogs) being harmed in certain ways. This level of anger that never seems to show up for pigs, snakes and fish-- or for the actions of male hunters (but women who hunt can get death threats) much of this comes from people who, like me, use leather, kill and eat fish (or think it's normal) and buy products like eggs or bacon.\n\nThis consistency issue is a big deal to me because calling an action cruel in one context but normal or a sport in another speaks to an unwillingness to contemplate life from diverse perspectives. And there are so many things we ought to be questioning... beyond the torture of fish.\n\nThis critical moral question about how and if we can end much of this cruelty deserves an answer from humans who recognize the common joys and failings of each other. It should not be arbitrary, the result of cultural preferences. \n\n** to produce huge numbers of hens to lay eggs vast numbers of male chicks are summerly ground up, alive. Some eggs are more \"humane\" but they are not accessible to all people.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Common Core (esp. Mathematics) is a system that is fundamentally flawed and does not prepare students for the real world.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_39int7", "selftext": "To my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, what I have observed in my school's mathematics system shows that these skills rely heavily on memorization and calculation, much less on reasoning, and virtually none on application. I've looked at the Common Core website and seen that these accurately reflect the standards put out.\n\nLet's take the [Common Core Algebra standards](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/introduction/) as an example. If you scroll down to the Overview, you see that almost all of the skills listed are to solve equations or something of that sort. This is calculation. Common Core currently spends too much time on this, something relatively easy such that computers can do it. Some of this time needs to shift to the other branches of mathematics.\n\nI believe that algebra, as well as much of the rest of mathematics, should be used as a medium through which logic and reasoning are taught. Though computers can use logic to some extent, the human brain is much more capable and should be used for what it is needed for. [Here is a purely algebraic problem.](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1981_AHSME_Problems#Problem_30) Despite the concepts being purely algebraic, it requires high levels of critical thinking and reasoning in order to solve. This is the type of multi-step problem that should be taught in high schools, but is almost always not. Common Core does not require students to display this level of critical thinking.\n\nLet's take [Geometry for another example.](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/introduction/) If you scroll down to the Overview, these standards are somewhat better, since they introduce the notion of proof. However, on close inspection of the Congruence section, only a few basic proofs spanning a few basic proof types are necessary. These do not cover the important proof by contradiction and proof by induction, two kinds of reasoning that can be much better applied to the real world. It is also never required that the student prove any algebraic concepts, such as the quadratic formula. Most theorems in Geometry and all in Algebra are not proven, and the student is forced to memorize them. We have computers for that. We need people to prove and reason.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for concepts like Geometry to be taught in conjunction with other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus. I took Geometry in 8th grade, and though that is a bit early for Calculus, the idea of limits and things like that should have at least been touched upon. Why is it that the volume of a pyramid is Bh/3? The idea of taking some function to the limit makes it easy to prove this. Common Core does not cover this.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve touched very little upon the idea of application, and mostly because that\u2019s the most difficult one. We know that mathematics is applied in all sorts of STEM subjects, but what if the student is already set on taking a liberal arts major? They shouldn\u2019t be forced to study engineering with math. So, I think that the application of mathematics needs to brought back to its roots, being the application of logic. Programming is great way to apply this, and though maybe math class isn\u2019t the right place for this, every student already has a programmable graphing calculator anyway. Instead of forcing students to not use programs on tests like they do at my school, I think that the use of programs should be encouraged, since they demonstrate understanding of the basis behind all mathematics, which is logic. Maybe this is straying a bit far from the purpose of Common Core, and it shouldn\u2019t be implemented as a guideline, but perhaps as a suggestion it would be great.\n\nI\u2019ll be going through Common Core for a few more years, and I want to know if it\u2019s effective. Please CMV.\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I think reasoning is much more important than having formulas memorized for the real world.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One half of the population are men. So, 1.1% of the population comprises gay or bisexual men.\n\nI realize that the first statistic is not perfectly comparable due to the fact that some boys are molested by women, so I accounted for this and it doesn't make much of a difference:\n&gt;\"Women are the abusers in about 14% of cases reported against boys and about 6% of cases reported against girls.\"\n\nhttp://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/types/violence/child-sexual-abuse.asp\n\nSo 86% of boys molested were abused by men. 0.86*0.18% = 15.48%. That's still over 14 times what we would expect given the assumption that gay or bisexual men rape as often as heterosexual men. There's clearly a link.\n\n---\n\nNote that this has little bearing on my feelings about how gays should be treated; whether you've had bad luck pre- or post-natal doesn't change my sympathy.

{"title": "CMV: Reddit should no longer be considered an isolated subcultural space with different standards of behavior than in person interaction", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_39gv60", "selftext": "I've been here for more than 5 years and the more mainstream reddit becomes, the stronger the cognitive dissonance afflicting the hardcore users gets. I understand that 4chan exists, and that a lot of people use both, but reddit has never been and never will be 4chan. And in the age where everyone and their mother has a smartphone, the Internet no longer constitutes a compartmentalizated subcultural space apart from and not subject to the norms of regular society where invective and insight in equal parts is both accepted and encouraged. Anyone here can turn on their TV to cable news and see how valuable meaningless reproach is. It doesn't advance any ideas, it doesn't enhance any discourse. And it's no more valuable here. The average person, who is now an inescapable part of the Internet, doesn't see it that way. Most people under a certain age with dependable home internet connections and/or smartphones spend so much time online in some type of online communities that this famed dichotomy between online and \"meatspace\" is not relevant at all. The average person also doesn't see punching down as a manifestation of the much-extolled \"freedom\" of the Internet.\n\nAnonymous does not and should not mean dissociated. You may see your reddit handle as an identity, but many just see it as an alias, the alias of a human being who they just have not met personally yet. And so when FPH supporters subconsciously see their hate projected onto an identity they see as isolated and bound to reddit, it's pretty likely the human on the receiving end doesn't see that distinction. I don't understand why people are willing to say things on here to people they wouldn't be willing to spray paint anonymously on the side of the other person's house. I'm sure a lot of people would just assert a priori that the different platforms would give the same message different emotional resonances. But again, I doubt the person on the receiving end would make that distinction.\n\nYou shouldn't have to use your real name like Facebook or Battle.Net, but you should recognize that other users represent real humans. \"Polite society\" gets along just fine in the exchange of speech and ideas without textbook meanness.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Sometimes, the idea of being transgender perpetuates heteronormative society, and less people would consider themselves transgender if we didn't restrict people based on gender.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_39ejy5", "selftext": "Hi Reddit. With all the news over the past couple weeks regarding Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s transition and coming out, I feel now is a good time to discuss gender\u2019s role in society and its position in how people identify as an individual. I would like to preface myself by saying that I identify as a pansexual cis-male, and I certainly have zero issues with people that are transgendered. I do, however, get very confused as to *why* some people are transgendered.\n\n\nMany people use the phrase, \u201cI am a male trapped in a female\u2019s body,\u201d or, \u201cmy body is male but my brain is female.\u201d What does this even mean? From a very young age, people are raised with ideas imposed upon us that dictate what boys are and what girls are, and these perceptions have nothing to do with the biological sex of someone and are typically based upon baseless stereotypical personality traits or what that gender should like to do. We are taught boys should play with toy cars and tools while girls are supposed to like barbies and dresses. These stereotypes are completely disparate from the reality that people are often multi-faceted, and might like many things across several disciplines and across several \u201cgender\u201d boundaries. I, personally, love to wrench my own car, build things, and in the same day I might decide to look totally different and wear makeup as an artistic outlet or go out shopping with friends to look at heels. These interests have nothing to do with my biological sex, and shouldn\u2019t have an affect on how I identify.\n\n\nSociety has dictated that girls do certain things and boys do certain things. What does this mean when someone who is anatomically male tends to like a lot of the things that the opposite gender stereotypically likes? I think it\u2019s unfair to oneself to say, \u201cI like girl things so therefore I\u2019m a girl,\u201d or, \u201cI like looking like a girl so I\u2019m a girl.\u201d This idea of outward presentation equating to one\u2019s gender identity seems restrictive to me. I question how many people would identify as transgender if these societal norms became antiquated and everyone was truly free to express all sides of themselves regardless of physical sex. It should not be odd to be a very \u201cfeminine\u201d person (makeup, hair, dress, etc) and be anatomically male and identify as a male despite one\u2019s outward aesthetic. There shouldn\u2019t even be an emphasis in society as to what gonads someone possesses. I believe far less people would identify as transgender, especially considering some people that are transgendered do not want sexual reassignment surgery, if we, as a society, were more open minded about individuality instead of trying to group people together based on their gender. If one doesn\u2019t even want to have SRS, but they want to live their life \u201cas a wo/man,\u201d how is this not simply perpetuating the heteronormative ideologies imposed upon us? One shouldn\u2019t have to explain to society who they are with their gender just because they don\u2019t fit into the false dichotomy of male/female.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

People who deny it are being willfully ignorant.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_39e315", "selftext": "I legitimately don't understand how anyone could deny that 'privilege' (as a sociological concept) exists. To me, it's so obvious that certain groups receive beneficial treatment as opposed to other groups. On the whole, it's easier to be white than any other race, easier to be straight than any other sexuality, easier to be cis than to be trans, easier to be male than female, easier to be wealthy than to be poor. \n\nFrom what I hear, the most common argument from those who deny 'privilege' exists is that (to be reductive) a person with a particular privilege doesn't always sit on the top of the social hierarchy. For instance, a 'privilege denier' will say that privilege doesn't exist because rich blacks have better social outcomes than poor whites, or straight women face less discrimination than gay men. Therefore, white or male privilege doesn't exist, because these are examples of whites and men existing further down the social hierarchy than the people they are supposed to be 'privileged' above. \n\nI think this is willful ignorance. No one is suggesting that 'privilege' is a zero-sum game, or that some types of privilege are more 'valuable' than others, or that all privilege exists in all situations. Privilege is privilege. A wealthy black man may have a higher income, but that won't stop him being pulled over by the cops or detained when trying to enter his home. A gay man will be subject to homophobic slurs and threats of violence, but a straight woman will be cat-called and endure sexist jokes and sexual harassment.  \n\nUnless you're a black, gay, poor, MtF trans-person, you experience privilege in some portion of your life. You probably don't notice it, because it's the way things have always been. But it's willfully ignorant to say that you're not 'privileged' because some people are in a better station than you are. \n\nTo change my view:\n\nHelp me understand why people deny privilege, that isn't rooted in 1.) willful ignorance (citing Tumblr or other sources of bad information on the concept) or 2.) entitlement (\"I'm part of a supposedly 'privileged' class: why isn't my life amazing?!?!\") \n\nI'd like to stay away from arguments from so-called 'privilege deniers' as I think I've explained above why I don't think their arguments hold water, but if you think you've got an argument that dismantles the whole concept of 'privilege': lay it on me.       \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The Minimum Wage is Immoral.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_39csdz", "selftext": "I've heard some decent arguments for why the minimum wage is ineffective, but that is not what I'm arguing here. I believe the concept of the minimum wage itself is inherently immoral.\n\nI think that society *should* provide a baseline which no citizen will be allowed to fall below, but this burden should be shared equally. The minimum wage arbitrarily puts this cost on to companies that use low-skilled workers. Google doesn't provide their employees with a modern cafeteria and relatively high pay simply because they are a great humanitarian organization. They do it because the work they do requires highly-skilled workers and the market demands this kind of work be compensated with higher prices, and as a result, they don't have the media and politicians attacking them for being cruel to their employees despite simply paying them the market rate for their work.\n\nIf we had something like a universal basic income similar to the [Negative Income Tax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM), then this would ensure that all tax-paying citizens helped contribute to maintaining a safety net in the country. Instead, the minimum wage is a discriminatory tax that targets certain companies and ignores others based not on any moral principle, but instead on an arbitrary aspect of the work they do. The constitution explicitly outlaws any taxes that are aimed at a certain group for this very reason. It was considered unjust to do something like this. It was one of the reasons they fought the revolution."}
{"title": "CMV: Vulcans are superior to Humans", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_39cnaw", "selftext": "Humanity plays an out-sized role in the Federation. Given the numerous races and population of non-humans in the Federation, there's an inexplicable abundance of humans in high positions. It's understandable for the organization to be based out of San Francisco, where the 4 founding races formed the coalition of planets, but with 150 member planets spread over 8,000 light years, why is so much of the leadership human?\n\nThis isn't a superficial skin-color thing, we're dealing with marked biological differences between the races. Vulcans, despite their violent past, have achieved \"superhuman\" levels of mastery over their emotions, allowing them to become excellent administrators and politicians, and even if we were to assume that Humans and Vulcans have the same fundamental capacity for intelligence, Vulcan discipline gives them supreme focus to produce an inordinate concentration of highly educated citizens. Even in sheer physical prowess, Vulcans massively outclass Humans, \"Take me out to the Holosuite\" being an excellent example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Out_to_the_Holosuite\n\nHere, the Vulcans are shown to be physically far superior, DOMINATING the mixed-race (human dominant) crew fielded by the Human Captain, in a human sport, with a final score of 10-1. Nevertheless the crew of DS9 celebrate their single point as a victory of human will rather than learning from the experience that Vulcans are superior in so many ways. \n\nVulcans are known for logic, they take great efforts to avoid letting their emotions cloud their judgement. We all know of a prestigious Human starship captain for ignoring the odds in a situation and taking great risks over the protests of his even-keeled Vulcan officer. It's convenient that luck favored the crew so often after these brash and illogical decisions. These apparent \"successes\" for making the wrong decision only served to stroke this captain's ego and belief that his \"gut instincts\" are what qualify him to lead. How is this different from a foolish business executive making random decisions and claiming credit for successes, and blaming other factors for failures? The meritorious act is in the decision itself, not in the outcome. To judge the brash decision based on a fortunate outcome is a flawed post hoc reasoning, akin to throwing a dart, sliding a dartboard under it, and claiming an excellent throw! What if even a few of those risks resulted in the *likely* outcome where many if not all of the crew members were killed because the captain ignored the logical choice in favor of an unsupported gut decision? \n\nIf there are any flaws to be noted in the Vulcan people as a whole, it would be low birth-rates, a bias towards peace, and a relative lack of ego(despite whatever projections humans perceive in a Vulcan's taciturn face). Perhaps humans have seized so much power as a direct result of greed, ambition, and nepotism, allowing them to promote humans above more qualified non-human members of Starfleet? Nevertheless, it seems clear that Vulcans are superior to humans.\n\n(The tone's intentionally a bit tongue and cheek to make this discussion more fun, but the fiction really does seem to over-exalt humans in the Federation)"}

All service being public and everyone being paid the same wage with heavy income tax.Which would eventually leading to the abolition of wage/money.\n\nThe problem I see with this is that without  money a communist society would lose it's ability to do business with other countries, bartering not being a stable enough way of obtaining goods. The only way I see it working out is if the whole  or very substantial percentage of the planet became communist and hence incorporated in a greater system or having a closed economy which no country has.Now the big problem, I have with that is that contrarily to our current system which has varying degrees of privatization and interventionism, communism leaves little place for those variations, it is unlikely that every country on this planet will adopt the same exact political system (due to there different situations both cultural and economic). I don't even think there has been a point in human society where that happened.\n\nAlso, there is the pretty common argument of lack of incentive.Money is a tool that insures regularity, you regularly get paid and with that pay you can seek out things that stimulate and please you or that you need for your health and safety.Without it the motivator that seems to remain is love for one's craft or love for the collective which are much less stable and prone to decrease time goes on for most people. It may seem like I am digressing, but your nervous system (including your pleasure centers) is made so that once you face a stimuli enough times in the same way , you develop a level of habituation. For example, once you've had your shirt on all day, you no longer feel it unless information relating to it is pointed, once you do a certain activity that brought you pleasure each day your nervous system no longer releases dopamine (making you feel pleasure) and have to modify it to get the same high (think of an addict taking a larger intake or a food/porn addict who develops more eclectic tastes relating to his/her addiction). In short, banking on peoples love for their jobs seems to be risky as those people would eventually no longer be as stimulated doing their job and without any need of wage they would be free to quit, not get a job or lower their assiduity. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, I often hear Pro-Life politicians and others advocate exceptions for abortions in these circumstances. Many Pro-Lifers will concede that abortion can be appropriate when the mother's life is at risk. However, if a person truly believes that abortion is murder, but they are okay with abortions when the child is a product of rape or incest, by their values, does that mean they are stating that \"murdering\" an \"innocent\" is okay because of how they were conceived? I would love to hear some serious explanations of the rationality behind this view.\n\nEdit 1: /u/raptor6c I think offers a pretty effective conceptualization of the rationale. I still disagree with the implications of the position, but I definitely better understand the thought process. In his words:\n\n&gt;Murder and 'voluntary termination of another life' do not mean the same thing and are not semantically interchangeable. 'Voluntary termination of a human life' is a quasi-objective description of an event (I say quasi because I don't want to draw arguments about free will being subjective into the discussion). Murder has a connotation of 'unlawfulness' or 'injustice' as a required part of its application. Formally I would say murder is the unjust and voluntary termination of a human life. The key distinction being that the quasi objective event of a 'voluntary termination of a human life' may be either just or unjust depending on the circumstances of the event in question.\n\n&gt;Given this one can simultaneously hold the positions that 1) abortion is voluntary termination of a human life, 2) voluntary termination of human life is unjust except for in well defined scenarios, 3) being a victim of rape or incest is a scenario that justifies the termination of a human life if that life is one that was conceived by said rape or incest, and 4) no other scenarios besides 3) may justify an abortion.\n\n&gt;Thus it would be coherent to believe that abortion is murder unless rape or incest led to the conception.\n\nEdit 2: Let me clarify that this discussion is focused primarily on someone who identifies as Pro-Life, equates abortion as murder, and advocates outlawing abortions except in the cases of rape and sometimes incest.\n_____\n\n*Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: So-called \"fat taxes\" should not be on junk food, they should be on pants.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_39ayy8", "selftext": "As more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this epidemic.  While pigovian (no pun intended) taxes of this kind may have been effective for things like alcohol or tobacco, I believe they only work when the tax makes up the majority of the price of the product.  An extra ten cents on his morning can of gravy isn't going to make fatso switch to Slimfast.  \n\nUnfortunately doubling or tripling the price of junk food would completely destroy the market for these things and put manufacturers out of business almost immediately.  This is because there are easy untaxed alternatives to junk food, unlike booze and cigarettes.  Granted you could grow your own tobacco and brew your own beer, but that takes months, while making junk food from tax-free ingredients takes minutes.  Plus if a steak cost the same as a bag of chips people would simply become obese on sirloin rather than Doritos.  \nRaising the price of food like this would also be harmful to the poor, especially considering junk food often provides the most calories for your dollar, and is thus essential for many poor people to meet their daily nutritional requirements.  Say what you want about a diet high in fat and sugar, it's still healthier than starvation.\n\nIn addition it's grossly unfair to punish everybody when it's only the obese that need to cut back.  Even alcohol and tobacco would be relatively harmless in moderation, but in practice it would be too difficult for a vendor to tell if someone is an alcoholic chain-smoker or if they have self-control.  On the other hand, much to their chagrin, nobody has ever mistaken an obese person for slim, no matter how strong the elastic in their girdle.\n\nUnfortunately if such a system were implemented many fatties would cheat it by having skinny friends or relatives buy their junk food for them.  The only viable solution as I see it would be not to tax food, but rather pants, say by $5-10 per inch the waistline is larger than the inseam.  This would ensure that only the fat would have to pay fat taxes.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The idea behind both of them is to manipulate the distribution of genetic material.\n\nSome explanation:\n\nIn artificial selection (AS), we manipulate which dog/cow/cat breeds and which doesn't. The end goal appears to be the maintenance of a breed, as seen in the strict definition of breeds by the American Kennel Club. Furthermore, either based on observation over generations of dogs or perhaps even pure creativity, each breed has associated characteristics, such as loyalty, intelligence, playfulness, etc. You can find all the defined breeds and associated characteristics [here](http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/).\n\nQuite clearly then, AS works. We did, afterall, turn wolves into dogs, and no one in 2015 will deny that a wolf is inherently different from a dog.\n\nHowever, when the topic of eugenics (artificial selection of humans) comes up, it invariably devolves into accusations of racism and hatred. Probably in no small part thanks to the deeds of the Nazi party, and the unadulterated racist motivations of past advocates of eugenics.\n\nWe already know in 2015 that there are certain diseases that are purely the result of genetics. Some of these are horribly debilitating and fatal, such as Cystic Fibrosis, which affects something like 30,000 people in the US alone. Thus, I posit the argument that controlling breeding based on genetics can help mitigate the spread of such diseases.\n\nSecondly, if we can breed dogs to have certain characteristics, such as loyalty, playfulness, etc., there is no reason that we cannot do the same to humans. I strongly believe that we can breed out crime, stupidity, and other social ills simply by focusing the species' breeding program on \"desirable\" characteristics, such as intelligence (see genetic factors in intelligence), altruism (see biological argument for altruism, etc.), etc. etc.\n\nOf course, there's the fear that with eugenics and the manipulation of breeding for \"desirable\" characteristics will lead to a society ala Gattaca. I have no doubt that these superior humans will end up occupying the upper echelons of society. But yet, one cannot deny that this ultimately serves the Greater Good of the species.\n\nI think I've written enough on the matter for now. CMV.\n\nEDIT: I now recognize that there may be concerns about how draconian it will be to use government enforcement for eugenics. Thus I propose that a community vote be used to determine if an individual should be allowed to breed. We already vote for representatives who then write laws that affect all of us as individuals. It doesn't make much of a difference for the community to decide if you should breed.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The near-unanimity of these feelings against this practice have led me to question my own view, so I came here to see what y'all think.\n\nThere are a few reasons why I think this would benefit society as a whole:\n\n1. **Helping trans (and cis!) people not be misgendered.** Most men don't like being mistaken for women, and most women don't like being mistaken for men. This includes trans men and trans women, who likely have to confront it more often (and, on top of that, who can see it as yet another unwelcome reminder that other people don't see them the same way they see themselves). Right now, people are generally expected to assume the gender of the people they meet based on appearances, but that clearly isn't reliable, especially when it comes to trans people. If asking for pronouns becomes normal, these awkward interactions will be eliminated.\n\n2. **Bringing trans acceptance into the mainstream.** One of the biggest obstacles I've seen to trans acceptance is the attitude that we can, or we should be able to, tell a person's gender just by looking at them. The very act of asking for someone's pronouns assumes that you can't tell just by looking, so this change would entail acceptance of the fact that you can't assume someone's gender just by their appearances.\n\nThe only downside I see to this is the trivial amount of time it would take to ask the question and the effort of remembering people's answers, which hardly seems more difficult than remembering someone's name, once you've gotten used to it. \n\nObviously I think this would be difficult to do and would take a while to actually become mainstream (if it ever does), so an argument that \"it's just too difficult to do this\" would probably be unlikely to change my view. My argument is that a world in which this social norm exists would be better than a world without that, and that this is something we should at least strive for. \n\nI look forward to seeing what you all think!\n\n"}

The movies and the EU so for the purposes of this discussion, I'd love to include the EU as well.\n\nBut here's my thinking. Darth Vader is always seen as the ultimate badass. A tall powerful Sith lord with an awesome personal ship and his own Star Destroyer. He is the epitome of an intergalactic villain. \n\nHowever, I'd say that according to the traditional Sith myths (including the Bane and post-Bane era), he was the least influential and least \"Sith\" out of everyone.

It's like he didn't crave the Sith Lord mantle, he just wanted to get rid of his maniacal master.\n\nWe all know he's a skilled mechanic and pilot but he didn't do anything with that. Out of all the Sith, he could have restored the use of Force-infused craftsmanship but he didn't. As a Sith pilot, he could have explored unknown reaches of the galaxy and expand the Empire's influence beyond known galactic space (finding new hyper routes, enslaving nations, etc.) but he didn't.\n\nSo all in all, his contributions to the Sith were minor and he could hardly even be considered Sith.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Extreme hunters are morally equivalent to omnivores.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_395yf9", "selftext": "So-called 'extreme hunters' like giraffe killer Rebecca Francis regularly and deservedly receive public shaming, but few of us think twice about grinning at our lamb chops come dinner time.\n\nNo, this will not be another tired vegetarian diatribe; I want to pose the question as to why we humans seem to have a tendency to readily aboard the vigilante bandwagon for the giraffe killer but not the lamb killer. If both animals are equally peaceful and unthreatening to us (giraffes and lambs), what makes us react to Rebecca Francis with such vitriol but then react with such nonchalance to human omnivores, ourselves included?\n\nThere's no shortage of gruesome scenes being pictured in animal rights campaigns, so the macabre happy snaps next to the dead giraffe couldn't have been macabre only due to the dead animal being in frame. No, it was probably the fact this dead animal was a giraffe. I mean, come on! A giraffe! Who does that?! Well, perhaps we're simply unaccustomed to the idea of dead giraffes. It might be so far from 'normal' (to us) that it just makes it automatically wrong.\n\nIt's a bit like if I said I had intimate relations with my sister. For the record, I have no sister and so have had no such relations. But if I did, you'd probably say it was disgusting and unethical - but why? Couldn't there be some instances of incest which are moral? What if we'd used protection, were both adults at the time, fully consented to whatever standard, no one other than ourselves knew, and it didn't have any negative consequences whatsoever now or in the future? According to research by moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt, you're still more likely than not to react negatively to this scenario, despite there being few if any good reasons left for thinking so. Haidt termed this 'post-hoc rationalisation', our tendency to jump to an intuited moral answer and then come up with its justifications afterwards.\n\nHave we merely intuited our moral outrage to Rebecca Francis' photo next to her long-necked victim? Partly, perhaps. If the economic world was flipped and our centres of global commerce and industry were in Africa, we might live in a society which farmed giraffes and wildebeest instead of sheep and cattle. In such a society, a dead lamb might set off the same reaction as a dead giraffe has in our society, it would be equally far from 'normal'.\n\nThough this isn't just about what's normal and what's not. Part of our reaction was reasoned, not all of it was intuited - or, at least, our intuitions happened to be supported by good reasons in this instance. Online commentators reasonably posed questions like Where's the fun in killing a giraffe? and Can't you find enjoyment someplace else, perhaps where you're not killing?\n\nWhat's intriguing about these questions is how easily they can be transposed to the act of eating lamb chops: where Rebecca Francis killed a giraffe for apparent mere enjoyment, many of us regularly participate indirectly in the killing of lambs for mere enjoyable sustenance. Where's the fun in killing a lamb? and Can't you find enjoyable sustenance someplace else, perhaps where you're not killing?\n\nNow, I did promise this wouldn't get too preachy, so instead of dwelling on these questions, let's consider how and why this cognitive dissonance occurs.\n\nFor one thing, most of us who eat meat aren't directly involved in the killing or otherwise of the animal, whereas Ms Francis was (and seeing a grinning killer lying next to a carcass readily sets off emotional dials). And how could someone be happy about such a peaceful animal's death if it was only for that sake alone? At least lamb-eaters aren't necessarily happy about the death of the animal they're eating, but are merely happy about their culinary experience - a consequence of the animal's death.\n\nHowever, if the experience of 'extreme hunting' is actually what Rebecca Francis is happy about (which seems likely), then her enjoyment isn't necessarily anything more than - like meat - a consequence of the animal's death.\n\nIf mass-produced lab meat was indistinguishable from 'real' meat, might we feel more comfortable hoeing into our lamb chops? I think so, and I think we'd care a lot less about Rebecca Francis' happy snap if it was taken next to a life-like robot giraffe.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You've all given me a lot to think about and while I still haven't moved in my position it's possible that as I digest all this information I might.\n\n\n\n\n\nI was browsing the internet reading some articles discussing trans-sexuality when I stumbled upon an article debating whether or not trans people (specifically ones who had surgery to alter their sexual organs) should be morally, or even legally, obligated to disclose their biological sex to their potential partners before any sexual activity took place.\n\nI thought this over for awhile and came to the conclusion that they absolutely should. I now believe that it is incredibly insensitive, bordering on criminal, not to disclose this information.\n\nImagine you're a Male-to-Female trans whose had sex-surgery. It's late on a friday night and you're really hitting it off with a guy at the bar. One thing leads to another and you end up at his place where you start to get intimate. At this point you must know that it is an almost statistical certainty that you are dealing with a straight male (Roughly a 96% chance). You also must know that he is almost certainly under the impression that you are a female in both name and biology. However, you know that the latter is not true. No matter how you slice it, you are not a biological female but a male who has had sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nLet's stop right there for a moment.\n\nWhere I come from if you are participating in a social transaction and are aware that the other party has been given a false-impression of what the transaction entails, it would be wrong to progress until you rectify their misunderstanding.\n\nImagine this:\n\nI'm walking down a downtown street and see a homeless man laying on the sidewalk. I walk up to this man and pull out a seemingly ordinary quarter.\n\nI say to the man laying down: \"Ya' know I have an amazing ability to predict whether or not a coin will land heads or tails when flipped?\"\n\nHe replies: \"No I did not but perhaps I could put that coin to better use than just flipping it?\"\n\nI reply: \" How about a little wager. If I correctly guess what side this quarter lands on 10 times in a row you owe me $10. If I guess incorrectly even once you win $10 plus the quarter.\" \n\nThe man agrees to the wager figuring it's unlikely I could correctly guess a coin flip 10 times in a row.\n\nI then reveal that the quarter I hold is actually double headed. Obviously I win the bet and take what little cash the man had with me.\n\nWas I morally bankrupt? Of course I was. I violated the man's trust. I intentionally went out of my way to deceive him into an unwinnable wager with a play on words and subtle suggestions. According to the logic of some in the trans community however, it wasn't my responsibility to correct the misconceptions he had even though I specifically set it up in such a way so that it was more likely for those misunderstandings to arise.\n\nBut I digress, let's get back to our individuals from the bar shall we?\n\nBy now you're both completely naked and the man sees that you have what appear to be real breasts and a real vagina. He has almost no reason in the world to believe that you are not a women. Again, however, you know that his assumptions are incorrect. You are a biological male who has altered their body to look and operate SIMILAR to a female's.\n\nFinally you have sex and the next morning you inform the man that you are actually trans. The man immediately regrets having sex with you. Not only because he is not sexually attracted to transsexuals but also because he believes you abused his trust.\n\nNow there are some who would still argue that if the man had such a problem with having sex with a transsexual he should have mentioned it beforehand. To which I counter with:\n\n1: A man is naturally 5 foot 5 inches tall. He decides to go overseas to receive height-enhancement surgery to increase his height by 4 inches thereby making him 5'9. He returns to the US and a few months later he goes to a sperm bank to donate sperm. The form he has to fill out asks him to accurately state his height. He lists it at 5'9. \n\nWhile that man did not lie, he gave information that he knew was misleading. This information could greatly affect the choices of a women looking for a surrogate father. He argues that if the sperm bank really cared about his natural height, they would have explicitly stated as such.\n\n2: One day a man returns home from work to find his fiancee having sex with their neighbor. He freaks out and asks why she would do something so terrible to him to which she simply replies \"You never specifically told me I couldn't screw other guys. If it meant so much to you, you should have mentioned it\".\n\nObviously that logic is ridiculous. In America, when you enter a serious relationship with someone you are agreeing to an unwritten, unspoken social contract. One of the default conditions of that contract preclude having sex with anyone that is not your significant-other. If you are seeking a relationship that does not operate within this social contract then YOU are the one that needs to speak up and inform your partner beforehand.\n\n(I want to make it clear that I do not hate transsexuals. I do not find them evil or unclean. I do believe something is wrong when you know an individual in a serious situation is being misled and do nothing to inform them of it. Especially when you know that the information you give them could drastically alter their course of action.)"}

The former has had it for the better part of a decade now and has become very active in a number of breast cancer awareness campaigns.  I've become a little more active here to be supportive.\n\nI understand the positive motivations behind phrasings like \"Save the Boobies\" or \"Save the Ta-Tas.\"  I get that they're a more lighthearted approach to breast cancer awareness and survival, and that they draw in (presumably, or at least arguably) more crowds than their serious counterparts, and that not everything surrounding breast cancer has to be sober or grim.  I don't begrudge people for gravitating towards this approach.\n\nMy CMV basically revolves around the fact that I'm concerned this marginalizes women who either proactively got a mastectomy or did so precisely because they absolutely needed to to survive. I think these people have a strong claim to awareness and survival and that the focus of these campaigns should be those two characteristics and not making sure women keep their breasts.  This is understandably important to many women, and I appreciate that, but I am uncomfortable with the notion that keeping breasts is a galvanizing feature for broad swaths of people and that we might be unintentionally excluding/marginalizing a core set of survivors.\n\nA few things that keep me from swinging entirely in this direction:\n\n- I could be completely off-base and maybe most survivors, including those who have had their breasts removed, are okay with this framing of awareness.  I defer to people who have gone through this experience more than me as a casual observer.\n\n- Women presumably want to keep their breasts and there's nothing wrong with that as an aspirational goal that can be part of the survival package.  I don't want to paint the picture that I think this desire is wrong or superficial.\n\n- If it was demonstrated that this kind of marketing has generated so much participation, awareness, and fundraising that its practical effects off-set any implication that we, as a society, are preoccupied with women keeping breasts rather than beating cancer.\n\nCMV, please.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've read more fiction than nonfiction so let me give some examples. \n\nIn the fiction category, I've read stephen king's \"the long walk\", \"needful things,\" and \"the shining\"; i've read pretty much all of crichton's books, and almost all of dan brown books. All are  quite popular books. \n\nFor comparison, the last 3 nonfictions I've read are [skunk works](http://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/0316743003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822539&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skunk+works&amp;pebp=1433822538925&amp;perid=1EH2CEACB9PWNS9GT84H),\" \"[the code book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Code-Book-Science-Cryptography/dp/0385495323)\", and \"[Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822683&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=north+korea&amp;pebp=1433822683392&amp;perid=11JG0BF3QCH819XQN6N9) \"\n\nSee, my view isn't that fiction is boring. However, in the limited span of time I have, I'd rather read 1000 pages worth of Introductory Chemistry, than 1000 pages worth of Needful Things; I'd have learned a lot more in The Code Book about cryptography than anything I would have learned from reading Jurassic Park (some basics about DNA and molecular engineering). \n\nBecause it's such a time sink, the amount of enjoyment from reading fiction is not worth the time it takes to read it. (1000 pages would take 1-2 days to read; I'd rather spend those 1-2 days watching movies or doing other time-sinking things that provides a much greater amount of pleasure). On the other hand, reading 1000 pages of nonfiction, while it would take even longer time, but it would let me get more out of it to be worth my time.\n\nCMV that reading fiction is somehow worth the time that it takes. \n\n**edit:** I've changed my view in the sense that not *all* fiction are created equal and I probably had been reading too much shitty fiction. I will try to make some efforts to read more nonshitty fiction. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: \"An armed society is a polite society\" just doesn't seem to be true in practice.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_394d2e", "selftext": "This is in light of the recent talk about police violence in the United States.  American police kill many more people per capita than in other wealthy, western nations.  Estimates vary, but 500-1000 a year seems likely for recent years.  Meanwhile, many wealthy western European countries have fewer than 10 police killings per year.  There are years when England has 0.  \n\nThe first argument people raise against this is that those places have less diversity / are whiter.  But that's not actually the case.  The old colonial powers have a lot of immigration from their former colonies and elsewhere, and European cities are a lot less white than I think a lot of Americans imagine.\n\nedit: and I just realized that the discussion could get hung up on this part, but if you look at The Guardian's [The Counted](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database) page like a total racist and just want to talk about white people killed, American cops still kill way more white people than cops kill people in general in other comparable economies.  I'm not interested in arguing the race aspect of this right now (maybe later though, because it is interesting) it's the next point I'm focusing on.\n\nThe second argument is that the police over there have less reason to fear for their life because criminals aren't as likely to have guns, and American cops have to adopt a more shoot-first attitude because they can't be sure that someone who is acting erratically / aggressively isn't armed.\n\nBut isn't that a giant argument for gun control?  If the right to bear arms means that we have to just be satisfied with having a police force that kills hundreds of people a year, how on Earth is it reasonable to say that widespread gun ownership is making us safer or more \"polite?\"\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The US committed genocide against the Indians, practised slavery, had institutionalized segregation until sixty years ago, allowed corporations to flat-out shoot unruly workers, and on multiple occasions made it illegal to speak out against the government. \n\n\n\nSo while many current deeds by the US certainly aren't good, in contrast to most of US history things are better than ever and aren't really getting 'worse' like the public outcry would lead you to believe.

I believe that although rare, it is justifiable to discriminate if the other group's acts are radically going against your belief and serving them will make you feel like you committed a sin against your beliefs and values. So for example, I believe that the pizzeria should be allowed to refuse service to a gay wedding, if he feels like doing that will violate his belief system.

Should we put warnings on descriptions of robberies for viewers effected by those crimes?  \nI feel it is too difficult to predict these sort of reactions and what sort of content may prove triggering.  At what point do the needs of the few who may be triggered necessaitate a trigger warning?  Isn't is possible, however unlikely, that *any* content could be triggering to *someone*?  If we start putting trigger warnings on everything, what is the point?  \nAlso, the reaction to people who don't put trigger warnings on their content is largely negative.

Not that I want to make an argument from authority, but this idea has some weight behind it.\n\n\nSummary of my reasoning:\n\n- The incidence (burden) of corporate income tax mainly falls on labor (one CBO study suggests 70%), decreasing wages. So decreasing the tax will increase wages, which is good both for the individuals and the economy.\n\n- Encourages corporations to stay in and move to the US, or at least reduces the incentive to dodge taxes.\n\n- Leads to economic growth, both through helping the stock market and reducing distortions in the free market. Most taxes tend to mess with the free market and are inefficient (other than Pigovian taxes on externalities), especially the corporate tax. \n\n\n- Won't mess with the deficit TOO much. The money that corporations aren't paying won't just disappear. It will go into stock transanctions (taxed via cap gains), salaries (taxed via payroll and income), etc. etc. If it drives economic growth, the tax base will also grow, which could actually make this tax cut self-funding.

Which seems unfair. \nNot to mention that if your parents have money to leave you, then the chances are you've had an upbringing which will already put you at an advantage. If your parents are very very rich, you'll have had incredible schooling, good food, holidays where you broaden your experience, chance to learn all sorts of things outside of school, you'll likely have been bought a house and car etc. If your parents are doing ok you'll have had good schooling and maybe a car and a few other advantages.

You're dead. You're not using it. Nothing to do with you any more. \n\n* \"I want to pass the house my kids grew up in onto them\", fine, as long as they live in it.

If they resist being detained, they can use force to detain you.  I'm not a lawyer or law enforcement, but I think this is how it works and is common sense.  Age or race does not preclude someone from following lawful orders.\n\nYou can see the order here (https://youtu.be/l4VayHJzaJU?t=2m20s ), she instead steps off in the opposite direction and is still talking at the cop, at which time he tries to detain her and she physically resists via pushing and pulling.  The cop in turn tries to push and pull her to the ground.  \n\nDuring her active resistance, a couple young gentleman approach in what initially seems an aggressive manner, with one of them moving their hand to their waste.  In hindsight, and slow motion on youtube, you can see that he was pushed towards the officer and off balance, but there was no way for that cop to know that at the time, so he drew his gun and backed them off.  I'm guessing that police are probably trained to do this.\n\nThe entire event concluded with one adult arrested, everyone else released and no injuries.  \n\nI think with all of the seriously horrible high profile police brutality in the news as of late, this story is getting caught up in America's typical response of reacting in an overly politically correct fashion, but I could be wrong.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Good would be something which promotes wellbeing. \n\nIn a wide variety of different areas we can see different ideas playing out, with many different views in direct competition. Religions make claims about the universe they cannot back up, scientists don't know all the answers to everything but are conservative in stating what they do know. Homeopaths claim their magic water has a memory and can fix any issue, but can't show it to be true. Chiropractors claim that the spine becomes misaligned through subluxations and this inhibits the flow of the vital force, causing illness, yet when asked to show a subluxation they can't show anything, and more interestingly conflict with each other. Acupuncturists claim that points on the body correspond with other places, and that piercing a point with a needle they can create theraputic results, but they can't even agree on which points to use. Terrorists, politicians, homo economis economists, and so on.\n\nAll of these groups use faith as their primary epistemology and therefore are immune from correction. When you use faith as your method for knowing about the world you can never get closer to the truth and therefore become opposed to someone out there. \n\nI think this leads to much if the conflict we see in the world. \n\nSo, my contention is as follows. Faith, claiming to know something you don't have evidence for, is a force for evil, and therefore degrades human wellbeing. "}

{"title": "CMV: Cyberbullying isn't a problem", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_38zcbm", "selftext": "I should start out by saying i didn't exactly word the title to the best of my ability, but it reflects my point of view better than any other way i could think of wording it. before i say anything else, i should set a general definition as to what cyberbullying refers to in this conversation. \n&gt;\"Cyberbullying\" is when a person is tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated, embarrassed or otherwise targeted by another person using the Internet, interactive and/or digital technologies.\n\nI don't believe this should be an issue at all, or at least not what the media makes it out to be. In the \"real world\", when someone is being bullied they cannot avoid it. this is usually because of two issues: 1. they lack the power to stop a bully. Ex: They are not strong enough to stop a physical harasser. 2. they cannot change the \"scenario\". Ex: A bully in the same class cannot be avoided.\n\nOnline, neither of those issues are present. Bullies hold no physical power and cannot touch you. If they continuously bother you, there are many ways to avoid them. simply by blocking them, changing servers (if present in a game), or by taking a break from using your computer.\n\nI want to make it clear that cyberbullying is different than using technology to ruin someone's life. Using a mobile phone to record something bad and blackmail someone would be physically bullying them. Telling someone to kill themselves on league of legends is \"cyberbullying\". \n\nI would love to hear what reddit has to say about this topic, i've always scoffed at the idea of cyberbullying and thought of it as another way people like to complain about nothing. Maybe i'm not seeing something. Is cyberbullying unavoidable? is it a serious issue? should anyone even care? Let's talk about it. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Laws and regulations restricting the \"power\" of firearms are ineffective and only serve to punish lawful gun owners", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_38y76d", "selftext": "I think the topic of gun *ownership* is pretty well covered, lots of interesting discussions have been made already. What interests me are places where guns are fairly obtainable, but there are restrictions on the power of these guns; I don\u2019t think this issue has been touched on very much, and I feel it\u2019s extremely important in areas that are affected. I would cite locations such as Massachusetts, New York, California, and Canada as examples of places with bans/regulations on things like magazine capacity, size/shape of the gun, and attachments/accessories. \nMy primary argument mirrors one from gun ownership, in that things like standard capacity magazines, almost all gun components, and most accessories are legally purchasable pretty much anywhere except the places with the stricter laws. Unlike complete firearms, making these purchases don\u2019t require going to extremely far away locations, dealing with shady individuals, or paying a significant markup. I don\u2019t believe these laws have any significant impact on anyone\u2019s ability to obtain these items.\n\nThis leads into my primary concern, which is that these laws are meant to incriminate lawful gun owners and discourage lawfully owning guns and accessories by making it annoying, costly, and a general waste of time. Low capacity magazines force users to bring excessive amounts of magazines for recreational/hunting use. It\u2019s quite annoying to have to constantly reload magazines and switch them when shooting high volumes of ammo. I don\u2019t buy the commonly cited rational, which is to make shooting sprees more difficult. For the aforementioned reasons, anyone with criminal intent can easily go get standard capacity magazines; if they\u2019ve got a gun the hard part is already over. \n\nAnother issue is the practice of deliberately keeping federal regulators, the BATF, understaffed and underfunded. To obtain accessories such as silencers or obtain permission to build a SBR, you have to pay a significant fee and then wait a stupid amount of time. Not only does this make it harder for the BATF to actually do their job, this fundamentally is making following the law as difficult as possible. I don\u2019t think there is any legitimate reason to use defunding as part of the regulatory process. \n\nIn addition to the uselessness of these laws, these accessories are far more likely to be used for recreational purposes, rather than illegal activities. Having something like a silencer is great for hunting or shooting at the range, and not much else. Unlike movie silencers, the sound of the gun is not going to be suppressed so much that nobody in close proximity will be aware a gun is being fired. It would take a very specific scenario to actually use a silencer in a meaningful way to commit a crime; someone robbing a gas station or shooting someone in the street can\u2019t ninja vanish just because they have a silencer.\n\nLastly, I would argue these laws have little to no punitive impact on criminals. There is a huge step up in punishment for those committing crimes with guns compared to having no weapon, or something like a knife. There is little change, if any, between committing a crime with a gun verses committing a crime with a gun and some illegal accessories. As stated earlier, I believe these punishments are more targeted towards lawful gun owners, as they usually won\u2019t entail anything more than a fine and restrictions in one\u2019s ability to own firearms. On the other hand, if someone has committed murder, armed robbery, or another heinous crime with their gun, these punishments would be the least of their worries. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If I get a $8 plate of eggs at Waffle House I am to tip about 2 dollars. If I am to get a $50 steak at the local trendy restaurant or steak house, I am to tip over $10? \n\nI understand that *generally* at a more expensive restaurant I will spend more time there making the servers work a longer time on my needs. And they are usually expected to be more knowledgeable about the menu. And the bus has to make thing look better and the bartender has to know more cocktails....\n\nBut it seems to me, the tipping tradition has propped up a non-egalitarian system where the young and attractive can rake in a decent pay check because expensive restaurants can be exclusive about hiring, and others, especially the older who probably did not really want to be stuck server their whole career, are left taking the 15% on my cheap dinner.\n\nIf I go in simply for a beer and a dessert, I try to tip above 50%. For \"affordable\" dinners I try to tip 25-30%. For nicer dinners I usually end up tip 15-20%. Truly bad service and I will only tip 10-15%. And if they have a truly helpful suggestion at that trendy restaurant I may tip over 20%.....\n\nI think we should move to a system based more on how long you are in the restaurant, and the amount of attention your visit actually needed, rather than a simple percentage completely isolated from the nuance of the service.\n\nBut the whole system just makes me feel guilty."}

I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes.\n\nI will try to explain my opinion.\nWARNING: looong rant ahead.\n\nI first watched Breaking Bad. \nI've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. \n\nThere are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. \nGus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. \nThe other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. \nIn the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. \n\nI still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. \n\n\nNow for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. \n\nI will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. \n\nThe show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. \n\nWhen the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrested/killed. \n\nHe could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay.\n\nThen there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe?\n\nAnd at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series.\n\nIt's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered \"grey\" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. \n\nTHIS is considered good TV. If this is the best TV has to offer, then I don't even want to bother watching any more of it.\n\nPlease try to CMV."}

Ideally, this means that we have [broad knowledge of the wider world (e.g. science, culture, and society) as well as in-depth study in a specific area of interest.](https://www.aacu.org/leap/what-is-a-liberal-education).\n\nHowever, despite being good students, having graduated from a relatively competitive school (one of the \"public ivies\") most of us are hugely lacking in our \"broad knowledge of science, culture and society\".\n\nLast night, twelve of us hung out at my apartment, and we talked a bit about this, and whether we have a \"broad knowledge of the wider world\".  We played a little game where we would ask the group what we considered a broad knowledge or critical thinking question, and kept track of who could either come up with the answer or answered in the affirmative.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nOut of the twelve of us:\n\nonly 7 said they would be able to solve a simple calculus problem (maximizing the volume of an open faced box given a rectangular piece of cardboard)\n\nOnly 5 got the correct answer to a [relatively easy logic problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl%27s_Birthday) \n\nOnly 6 got the correct answer to an [easier logic problem](http://i100.independent.co.uk/article/the-incredibly-simple-logic-puzzle-that-youll-probably-get-wrong--x1loz87b5WW). This one bothered me the most, since liberal arts is supposed to teach critical thinking, especially in the humanities, but it was only math and science majors getting this one right.\n\nOnly 4 were able to answer a [simple probability problem](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-favorite-bayess-theorem-problems.html) (The first one). This one also bothered me, since it needs no higher level math, it just involves critical thinking, yet lots of people (all the humanities majors, and some of the science majors) got this one wrong\n\n7 believed that the p-value from a statistical hypothesis test is the probability that the null hypothesis is true\n\nonly 6 had written any computer program in any language\n\nonly 4 said they would be able to solve the first few (very easy) programming challenges on [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/archives)\n\nonly 8 can read music\n\nonly 7 knew that Yugoslavia is no longer a state (the international studies major shockingly did not)\n\nonly 3 could name 3 or more of the current nations that used to comprise Yugoslavia\n\nOnly 4 knew what [the principle of parallx is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) and how it's used in astronomy\n\nOnly 3 have read Ulysses\n\nOnly 4 have read War and Peace\n\nOnly 4 could identify Iambic Pentameter\n\nOnly 5 could name 3 or more Central Powers and 3 or more Allied powers from WW1\n\nOnly 7 could name 3 or more Axis powers and 3 or more Allied powers from WW2\n\nOnly 4 knew what the battle of Hastings was about\n\nOnly 4 knew who the Jacobins were\n\nOnly 4 knew the difference between deontology, consequentialism and virtue ethics\n\nOnly 2 knew the difference between cultural relativism and moral relativism\n\n\nI have more of this if anyone is interested\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur majors were:\n\nMathematics and Philosophy (me)\n\nMathematics and Economics\n\nMathematics and Economics\n\nComputer science\n\nComputer Science\n\nHistory and Political Science\n\nEnglish Literature and History\n\nEnglish Literature and Psychology\n\nLinguistics and Psychology\n\nBiology\n\nChemistry\n\nInternational Studies\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy point is that we were all pretty good liberal arts students at a pretty good university, but all had serious gaps in being a well rounded, educated person, who is both good at critical thinking, and has a broad knowledge of the world.\n\nI think that part of the problem is that although our school compelled us to take breadth courses, they were trivially easy (for example, one of us was able to not take any math courses at college, simply because they took AP economics in high school, and they took an introductory Astronomy course that involved basic algebra, another example is that I have never had a college level biology course, I took two easy botany courses that taught virtually nothing about biology). My point though isn't why this is the case, merely that Liberal Arts don't, in general, provide a well rounded education. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, but that discussion is afield from this CMV post.\n\nI'd be willing to give deltas if (but not only if):\n\n* You convince me that my friends and I are simply abberations, and that most liberal arts students have better broad knowledge and critical thinking skills than we do\n\n* The questions that we asked each other last night were either too hard, or not indicative of broad knowledge and critical thinking. \n\n* We fared well enough on the questions such that we could be considered to be well rounded, educated people\n\n* Our school is not representative of most liberal arts educations - other schools compel students to study more broadly and work on their thinking skills better than ours did.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Many of the restaurants I go to now on the receipt list only 20%+ precalculated percentages.\n\n10% is not only easier to calculate (move the decimal point), it also has good leeway to adjust for good or bad service. At something like 20-25%, do individuals adjust to 40% for good service? \n\nIn addition, the higher tipping standards go, the less of a value indicator it is since people are generally inclined to only tip so much.

{"title": "CMV: The President of the US should not be in charge of the military.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_38qtp0", "selftext": "This view will be broken down into a few main points; Lack of Training, Corruption, Abuse of Power, and conclude with Overall Role of the President.\n\n* Lack of Training\n\nThe primary and most notable is that the President doesn't need any no formal training or experience with the Army. Now it may be true that the brunt of the responsibility for this is in the hands of the Generals but the fact that a no experience individual gets such influence on the behavior of the largest army on the planet, is just absurd. The president can go against the council of those generals and against the council of the CIA which has been seen many times in the last few decades.\n\n* Corruption\n\nHaving a single person with this much power over the army lends itself to corruption either from the outside or even worse, corruption from that individual who would use the army for personal reasons. For example, George Bush 2nd invaded Iraq in part due to the fact that Osama Bin Laden had attempted to kill George's dad in the past. He made the move with the army against the recommendation of the CIA who said the attacks came from Saudi Arabia, to get the man who hated his daddy.\n\n* Abuse of Power\n\nIt is frankly idiotic that the person in control of the army, can use that as a resource to gain 'Emergency Powers'. This is just a perfectly exploitable glitch in the system. This is made especally potent when you take into account that the president for some reason doesn't need permission from congress to go to war, invade another country, or deploy the military any way they choose.\n\nThe president also can abuse their power to get money that could circumvent the power of congress, allowing this one person to circumvent many powers of the legislative branch, and judicial branch; goodbye checks and balances. This still occurs through documented selling of firearms over seas after a 'totally legit invasion' of panama, iraq, or wherever else. \n\n* Overall Role of the President\n\nThe president is a figure head more than anything, cluttering the role of the president with control over the armed forces just adds unnecessary strain to the role of the president who should focus on being Head of State and communication with the public, not foreign affairs, the state of the army, or anything of the sort.\n\n* Conclusion\n\nSo what should the president be of not commander in chief? What the president is now; Head of State and Head of Government. I see no issue with having the elected office of the president simply being a figurehead role, and having commander in chief be a separate role chosen either by the president or through a panel with The Generals of the Army.\n\nMany people say the president actually has less power than people think, and this is true because many people think the president controls legislation, which they do not. But the president does have more power than a single individual in a balanced government should have; power of the army, power of uncontested 'emergency powers', and a nigh endless amount of unbounded cash to use globally.\n\n* To CMV\n\nI must see a reasonable argument as to why each of these is wrong because if even one of them stands it is a legitimate reason to remove the Commander in Chief title from the Presidency.\n\nor\n\nYou must show a reason why transferring the role to a separate person or to the army  leaders as a group, would be a worse alternative than its current state.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We should start negotiations to get them to share the water. Or we could help the downstream neighbor develop a new source of water.

{"title": "CMV: I don't think it's possible to change the view of a logical layperson with \"evidence.\" You can only convince illogical laypeople and professionals with \"evidence.\"", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_38p6le", "selftext": "My position is pretty simple but I might have problems articulating it. I think a logical layperson would not be convinced by \"evidence\" because there would be no way for the layperson to differentiate between bad evidence and good evidence. By bad evidence I am referring to evidence that omits, contorts, or out right lies about something. Because of this fact I believe a logical layperson has to either trust or not trust the experts. Depending on how obviously correct a subject is effects whether or not trusting the experts is reasonable. For example, it's reasonable to trust experts in computer science because they produce functioning products that can be repaired by engineers using different information about computers.  I think laypeople who believe/disbelieve in some less concrete/tangible subjects, like history, are being illogical.\n\nTherefore I think people should avoid trying to convince laypeople about subjects and instead try to convince experts in their fields. This is because any attempt to convince a layperson would rely on them acting irrationally. \n\nEdit: A lot of people are using analogies that I feel are missing the point of my question. I feel like this is because I haven't made clear what I mean by a layperson. One commentator tried to use an example of the sun being a giant ball of gas. I feel like nobody is a layperson when it comes to a topic like that because general high school education equips you with enough knowledge to understand and test that idea. For example, there are many tests people can do with a telescope to show that the earth is a sphere. What I'm specifically referring to are more obscure fields that lack a way for normal people to verify them. Some example of a field I have in mind would be history and quantum mechanics.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Take me, and another person who is currently not particularly smart. Swap how we were raised (give the other person parents who read to them, encouraged them to learn, question, and discover, etc, and who could afford to provide them with learning opportunities, and take away all those things from me), and you'd pretty much swap how smart we are. Maybe not exactly, but pretty close.\n\nThis is not solely about wealth, though wealth does play a role: a lower-middle-class parent who takes the time to take their kid to the library every week will obviously end up with a smarter kid than a wealthy parent who doesn't invest time and effort in their child\n\nNote: There are very few ways to either empirically support or disprove this view, basically twin studies are what you've got, unless I'm missing something.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: If you're ok with how athletes are paid, you should be ok with how CEOs are paid", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_38kidg", "selftext": "There's a lot of debate about how some people are \"paid too much\" for what they do. I frequently find that people who think CEOs are paid too much have no issues with how much athletes and movie stars are paid.\n\nCEOs, athletes, and movie star pay are all subject to the same laws of supply and demand. The owners of the movie, owners of the team, and owners of the company, agree to pay the amount.\n\nWhat's similar among them all are that they often don't last very long. These are high profile people. Mistakes, poor performance, and even bad luck means your contract won't be getting renewed and any chance of future employment can be lost.\n\nThese types of talents are what owners try to bring on board in hopes that they will make lots of money for them. To say that an athlete should not be paid so much is the same as saying the owner of the team should not be allowed to spend his money a certain way. I don't see how it is different for shareholders looking to employ a CEO.\n\nAt the end of the day, all of these are dictated by supply and demand. No one pays millions for an athlete if he doesn't believe that athlete would be an asset to the team. If someone is willing to pay the amount, there is at the very least, the belief that the amount is worth it. You pay a popular actor a lot because you're receiving the ticket sales of his fan base. You pay a CEO a lot because he knows how to negotiate better deals with suppliers or can provide the vision for the next product.\n\nTLDR - There's no difference between CEO's, athletes, and actors being paid a lot.

It's harder to negotiate a raise when you have no idea what everyone else is making. \n\n* A company I worked for had its private salaries leaked, and ended up resulting in employment shifts that were overall beneficial to the workers. \n\nBonuses, and any extra benefits associated with a position also must be disclosed publicly."}

Most pro-Kremlin posts I've seen receive such massive amounts of down votes, they are buried. \n\nPlus it must also be said that even in default subreddits, such as /r/worldnews, Russian articles make up tiny amounts of total posts made, and so I cannot see the logic in any major organisation, and much less the Kremlin, throwing even moderate amounts of resources at tiny amounts of posts for propaganda purposes. \n\nI also believe cultural bias plays a part. It's a safe assumption a decently large amount of reddit users are either American or European. With this, this lends itself to cultural bias, and what I believe has happened is that given the nature of reddit, this blurs the lines to the point where few redditors distinguish between merely Russo-appreciative posts and plain silly, biased posts, and so every post which is positive about Russia is deemed to be the work of a Putinbot. \n\n  You also see this in news sources- the same redditors who immediately jump on posts referencing RT (Russia Today) or The Moscow Times are the same redditors who will show nothing of the same discernment for posts which reference sources such as the Daily Mail, HuffPo or other Western news sources which could be argued to be biased. \n\nSo, CMV! \n  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

First used to refer to speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations, by the 17th century race began to refer to physical (i.e. phenotypical) traits. Starting from the 19th century, the term was often used in a taxonomic sense to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.\n\nThe very next paragraph nails it;\n\n&gt;Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies[7] that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. **Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete**,[8] and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.\n\nRace is a scientific theory its technical description is [biological essentialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism#In_biology).

I like stories about zombies even though I understand they are not real, but those stories don't actually hurt people.

{"title": "CMV: The US should make a $1,000 bill.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_38j6do", "selftext": "Currently the largest widely circulating US note is the $100.

It is really all about the benjamins.\n\nThe USD $100 has been the largest bill since the 1960s, when larger notes ($500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000) were discontinued, [having last been printed in 1945.](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911204022/http://www.moneyfactory.gov/section.cfm/5/42)\n\nInflation means that [the 1969 value of $100](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=100&amp;year1=1969&amp;year2=2015) is closer to $700 today.  So a $1,000 bill would be pretty close to the 1969 $100 bill.\n\nSo what are the upsides?\n\n1. It makes cash management easier.  Legitimate large transactions in cash still happen quite often.  It's simpler to do those with a small amount of cash, especially when counting out big stacks of $100s takes time, and in a public or semi-public place may attract attention, and result in [incidents like this.](http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20081208/three-men-arrested-in-string-of-follow-home-robberies-from-casinos)  Plus, it reduces counting errors in big transactions.\n\n2. It helps out people in countries with confiscatory governments.  A huge chunk of US cash lives outside the US and acts as a safe haven for people whose local currencies and governments are unreliable.  Saving in the form of a smaller number of bills helps these people avoid detection, which is a good thing.\n\n3. It gives us space to honor someone new on a bill without all the fighting that comes from taking someone presently on a bill off.  Maybe FDR or Reagan (depending on your political leanings).\n\nAnd the downsides?\n\nA. Money laundering would be facilitated.  I don't think this can be gotten around so easily, but I also don't think cash money laundering is a huge problem in and of itself.  I don't know that it would be made much worse by this.\n\nB. Counterfeiting would be a problem, since the new bill would be a very juicy target.  The $1000 CAD [Birds of Canada note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_Canada_%28banknotes%29) was highly counterfeited, and if you want to deposit one to a bank today, you need to have the serial number run to make sure it's legitimate.  This seems more solvable, especially if modern technology like polymer notes are used.  The [current Canadian banknotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Series) are an example of extremely hard to copy notes that could be used. \n\nEdit 1: I'm trying to get to everyone here, but this blew up a little.

By punishing murderers or similar offenders with murder, the judicial system essentially lowers itself to an ethical level akin to that of said offenders. While this is technically a kind of punishment, it is not the one we should advocate, as it conflicts with the moral principles we have determined for ourselves.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that death is a final event - an irreversible one - means, that juridical mistakes have a much bigger consequences. If an innocent is erroneously put under arrest for years, he can still be released and even compensated once his innocence has been proven, but you cannot revive an innocent who was killed for something he did not commit.\n\nAdditionally, Capital Punishment is even [economically](http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty) more unfavorable than imprisonment, mainly due to higher defense costs for a death row candidate.\n\nResting upon these aspects, I hold the firm belief that Capital Punishment is ethically wrong and unjustified, while also being more of an economical burden than imprisonment.\n\n(Note: Because English is not my native language, parts of my reasoning may be wrong or not make any sense. Thank you for your understanding.)\n\nEDIT: I would like to add, that I am in favor of deliberately ending your own life and consensual suicide. Inmates should have the right to end their life, if they voice their opinion in a stable, mental state.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: Morality and ethics are made-up and you can do anything you wish without remorse", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_38gmtu", "selftext": "Hello everyone, before we proceed I want to make sure that you all understand one simple thing: I'm not a psychopath, I don't have any mental disorders beyond some OCD and I've had a lot of good moral influences in my life.\n\nI just don't think that it makes any sense.\n\nWhen I was 8 I couldn't understand what was the point of baptism, by age 9 I discovered what it was about: Religion. My parents were atheistic and I was so for my whole life so I immediately freaked out and became absolutely anti-religion. It seemed like a joke, you can't simply believe in things that can't be explained rationally, you can explain how a car works from the top to the bottom within a few weeks or months, but with religion at some point you're stuck with a huge \"either you believe it or you don't\", or even worse, \"if you had faith you'll understand\".\n\nBy age 10 I became interested in politics and philosophy, I was very interested in moral dilemmas, I was fresh in high school and I got to the library and started reading from time to time. There were a couple of really good books with several moral dilemmas that I read several times.\n\nUntil my 13s I kept developing those areas, I started off being communistic, then socialistic and then social liberal, I thought about life and death, morality, ethics, utilitarianism and everything else there was to know about those subjects.\n\nThen when I was 14 I discovered it, I was on a car trip to visit my grandparents and I had nothing to think about for the whole trip, I had already been thinking at home (I was kinda bored of playing Age of Empires 2 for hours) and I kept thinking in the car. I don't exactly remember what made me jump, but after worrying so much about whether it was all about maximizing the total happiness, about whether embryos and fetuses should be considered human, about whether morality and ethics should be anthropocentric or not... I just gave up, nothing made sense.\n\n\"What if morality and ethics just didn't make sense?\", that was it, I discovered it, there was no inherent reason to act in a moral and ethical way. I was stuck at the same thing that I got stuck with religion, I lacked faith, there was no reason to explain it all, morality was no car, it was a dogma, a wall where \"why?\" became \"because someone said so\".\n\nImmediately afterwards I thought about what was the point of living: Happiness. Life is about being happy, everything that people do they do it for a reason: Because it makes them happier. I had already thought of that last thing before, but now I could put it all together. Life is just about being happy, even if at the expense of others, nothing mattered but yourself.\n\nFor some reason I even made a [terrible blog](https://whitepillarsinsidethevoid.wordpress.com/) (warning: engrish) and a few [quotes](https://whitepillarsinsidethevoid.wordpress.com/2012/04/09/quotes-updated-eventually/) that would probably baffle several psychologists:\n\u201cWe are complex balls falling towards the end of our existence, our thoughts are just electrons moving in synapses and our memories just chemicals stored in our brain cells\u201d\n\nThat was quite dark and completely unrelated, though you can get a perspective on how seriously I was taking it all.\n\n\nNow regarding the arguments here are a few, they're similar or identical to the ones I made by age 14 and 15:\n\nExhibit A: Morality justifies itself. Why can't you kill an innocent person? Because it is wrong. Why is it wrong? Because you can't kill an innocent person.\n\nExhibit B: Morality has no clear limits. How can you be sure if your actions are right or not if they're not clearly delimited? If all humans should be treated fairly then why not treat animals in a similar fashion? First humans, then monkeys, then mammals, where does it end?\n\nExhibit C: Morality, just like religion, isn't learned rationally. Children are amoral and atheistic/agnostic, parents put ideas into them that shape them into dogmatic adult beings. The burden of proof is in the moral and/or religious person for this very reason, and thus there's no need on first place to disprove neither as long as the opposite is not proven.\n\nExhibit D: Solipsism. If you can't be sure that other minds like yours exist, then its pointless to treat them in any way different from the way you'd treat a mindless object or an animal.\n\n\nI've explained my story and my arguments, feel free to argue against me since from the start I've tried over and over again to be wrong, without success. Right now I act in a completely egoistic way, almost like I would otherwise.\n\nYou read that right, turns out that being amoral doesn't turn you into a monster. Yeah sure, I could kill anybody, and remorse is just an emotion and I have good emotional control anyway so its not that much of a problem. How many people have I killed so far? Zero. Why would I want to kill anyway? Prison isn't a nice place and I have a good temper.\n\nStealing? Can still get caught. Rape? Same. Turns out that the mighty hobbesian sword is the main force keeping society together, not morality (I'm not actually into book-ish philosophy but I like to borrow some concepts). Being amoral still means having to obey the law (unless the benefits outweigh the risks), it still means having feelings for other people and it still means being compassionate and even altruistic, not because I have any obligation to do so, but rather because I feel good acting that way.\n\nConclusively, this is my story, my arguments and my life, just like everyone else but I'm freer as my range of actions also include those that go beyond morality and ethics, even if for the most part I have no need to use that extra freedom.\n\nThis is not the story of my life nor I'm trying to convince you, I just wanted to put things into perspective before explaining my position to prevent any misunderstanding, so please feel free to discuss any or all of my arguments for the sake of rational improvement, I've been open to new ideas from the start and this subreddit seems almost too good to be true.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I realize the issues are irrational but what irritates me is when someone tells me I should \"talk to someone about them\"\n\nI'm not sure what talking to someone would do, as from every experience I've had they will just parrot back at me what I already know about the disorder.\n\nAside from maybe giving me medication, I see absolutely no value in \"talking\" to someone, when I've pretty much analyzed the root of most of my problems.\n\nWhen it comes to anxiety, OCD and trust, these are all things I'm extremely cautious about. Telling me to be *less* cautious about a valid threat is like telling me to be less cautious about walking through the ghetto at night.\n\nI can't possibly imagine what benefit a psych professional would give to someone who is aware they are irrational. \n\nThe neurotic precautions I take aren't on the scale of not leaving the house because a meteor might hit, they are legitimate precautions that most normal people admit to me are a valid concern, but that they \"try not to think about what could happen\" and thus don't take precautions.\n\nFor example:\n\n-Sleeping in my car instead of a hotel for fear of bed bugs.\n\n-Completely writing off living in apartments as an option for fear of getting bed bugs/cockroaches.\n\n-Throwing away food (as opposed to making a scene or eating it) if I see the food employee handle it with their bare hands, or inadvertently touch the side of the napkin that will grab my pastry with their dirty hands, before picking it up.\n\n-Unscrewing my lightbulbs before I leave my house to confuse potential burglars.\n\n-Taking alternate routes if I see a gravel truck a mile ahead of me on the highway, as opposed to being forced to inevitably pass it and get my car pelted with stone chips.\n\n-Dating, at all. Would not commit to someone unless I was on a desert island where noone else could interfere. Dating in a dynamic world where I am anything less than a top 10% male is too risky, as all it would take is a determined individual with more to offer than myself and an opportunistic time.\n\n-Expiration dates: When in doubt of how long a food item was opened for I throw it away, even if it's a condiment that tends to have a long shelf life. Unknown = toss. I wasted so much money doing this I now exclusively eat out to avoid having to throw food away.\n\n\nSo as you can see I have rational concerns but irrational worry about them. Telling me *not* to do any of those things is asking me to be more vulnerable to threats with relatively high probability of happening. IT isn't like I'm afraid of meteors and volcano's here... I spend too much time researching things and have become hyper aware.\n\nFor example, each one of the things I listed, a person in that profession may also do the same thing I do, for example a pest control professional might also avoid hotels, knowing the high risks.... a car detailer might also avoid highways if he sees a gravel truck, and a food safety professional might also throw food away if he sees a dirty hand touch it...\n\nthe problem is because I research everything, I have developed the \"experts precaution\" on just about all of it... and it costs me a lot of time and money, though I don't see what a psych could do other than prescribe me meds or tell me to be more accepting of risk.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Suffering, grief, and starvation are universally bad. Personal fulfillment and health are always good. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging what's working and what isn't, even across cultural boundaries. However, I don't support the kind of ethnocentrism that thoughtlessly assumes my own values are the best (aside from the universals I mentioned).\n\nSome cultures are better at promoting the good and minimizing the bad. Norwegians are better at it than Somalis, overall. The two countries are near opposite ends of every ranking of national happiness.\n\nA Nord could criticize a Somali for honor-killing his raped daughter because Nordic morals are more successful at promoting overall wellbeing than Somali morals.\n\nThe reasoning the Somali man is likely using is that consent is not a factor in sex, so she is culpable and profoundly sinful. Honor dictates that he protect his family's reputation by killing her. This conforms to his idea of Islam and is the best way to protect the immortal souls of himself and the remaining \"pure\" members of his family.\n\nThe Nord would see a misogynist man selfishly protecting his own standing in the community by harming a disenfranchised girl under the dubious pretext of preserving the purity of \"souls,\" the existence of which no reliable evidence supports. What's more, helping oneself by hurting others should be discouraged because the Nords believe it degrades the level of wellbeing in a society, and they would know-- they're near the top of the happiness charts.\n\nSome people practice critical thinking and do their own moral reasoning. Others follow the less mentally demanding path of tradition. The result is that some people develop moral skills that maximize health and happiness and minimize suffering. Better educated nations do better at this. Norway has great education, Somalia has terrible education. Thus some nation's morals end up superior to others.\n\nEDIT: All you downvoters are advocating murder. Please read the text before clicking. Honor killing is *wrong.*"}

The negative repercussions vary widely in scope, but are almost always worse than the alternatives to deregulation. \n\nAn easy example is tobacco. A cash crop like weed, and the same basic stigmas attached to it. I understand the scientific discussion about the toxicity of both, but why not let the market drive the success or failure of the products based on their perceived dangers and benefits? And if pot is safer, couldn't it be a safer and more sought alternative than tobacco? Isn't this more effective than simply regulating tobacco? The most common argument for legalizing pot I see is that we should be able to choose our own safety for our own bodies.\n\nWell, why not live by this logic? What about regulating airbags in cars? Shouldn't there be alternative choices for my own personal reasons? \n\nSame with the practice of medicine. Why does the AMA decide an adequate doctor?

He additionally used parts of his filibuster in a political video made for his campaign.  While I know my opinion that it is important to renew the patriot act is unpopular here on reddit, I think that it is fair that anyone who agrees with the act or not should consider the fact that Paul intentionally stalled debate on the matter, a matter of national security.  While Rand held the floor, shouting the same ideas over and over again in various permutations of the same couple lines about the government committing criminal acts and how American freedom is being violated, no informed debate on the matter could occur.  To prevent debate on a matter of national security like this I believe is already irresponsible, but to then to blatantly use this restriction of informed debate for the sake of promoting his own presidential bid makes it even more irresponsible.  I don't think that it is necessary for one to agree with the provisions of the patriot act (though I do) in order to believe that what Rand Paul did was incredibly irresponsible.\n\nNow, I would anticipate that I will get some responses saying I likely find filibusters an irresponsible practice.

After all, it  was only thirteen years ago that sodomy was illegal in some states, and it was only twelve years ago that the first state legalized same-sex marriage.

Whites tip me, Hispanics tip me, Asians as well; blacks...?ha! I digress but I hope my point is clear. I approach a known black customers house knowing the chances are that they will not tip me. It minimizes the dissapointment. It is beneficial to me to enter into these interactions using a stereotype to my advantage.

Even with the surgeries and artificial hormone replacements, wouldn't the artificial nature of these changes render the claim illegitimate? From a societal standpoint, obviously the idea of gender identity is one that has, for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?\n\nThis post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated.

{"title": "CMV: The Witcher 3, if worthy of any note at all in regards to gender-bias, should be admired by Feminists - not scorned.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_384cfs", "selftext": "POTENTIAL SPOILERS for both Witcher 2 and Witcher 3. I've completed Witcher 2 and act 1 of Witcher 3. I'll try and mark them, but I warned you.\n\nFor starters: I read an article today that really bothered me. [See here.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2015/05/31/why-feminist-frequency-is-dead-wrong-about-the-witcher-3/)\n\nIn summary: a pair of feminists apparently known as the \"Feminist Frequency\" are now throwing stones at Witcher 3. What I don't get is that, as far as I can tell from my non-Feminist masculo-mind, is that the game is almost a perfect representation of what so many people cry out for in regards to video games and breaking the trends of all of Feminism's buzz-words.\n\nThe McIntosh guy seems to be going on and on about how Geralt lacks emotion, men need to cry, blah blah blah - so on and so forth. See [his Twitter](https://twitter.com/radicalbytes). I have to agree with what Kain says in his article about McIntosh: either he hasn't played the game at all or he's intentionally choosing dialogue options to make Geralt a sociopathic murdering machine - in which case he needs to turn that all-powerful analytic mind of his in on himself. Geralt, despite the fact that Witchers are rumored to be stripped of emotions when undergoing mutations, is an extremely emotional and complex character with strong feelings for each of his companions. Hell, even the other Witchers you encounter throughout the game portray emotions as you explore conversation opportunities with them. I can honestly say I have never played a game that manages to make so many of its characters seem legitimately human. But this guy over here is screaming \"hegemonic masculinity!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sarkeesian is going on and on and on about [gendered insults](https://twitter.com/femfreq). My only response to that is: toughen the fuck up. People call me a dick, people call me an asshole, I don't get up in arms about it or take any more offense than if they'd called me a bitch or a cunt. The game is *extremely* immersive, that's part of the thing that makes it so incredibly popular. Regardless of the monsters and ghouls, the game is set in medieval times and with that comes a certain environment. If anything it's a reminder of how far we've come.\n\nThey're cherry picking an otherwise excellent title is such not only because of it's *immersive* content, but also because it (from my understanding) fulfills so many of the things that I see people in other debates here begging for regarding video games. But here's the thing: look at the feedback on their shit. There's far and beyond more people supporting what they're saying than against it. So wtf?\n\n* I will concede that the main character is a male, and nothing you do can change that. However: there is some very serious character development around Ciri in which you get a feel for her personality. You get to play as her, and you play through her story just about as much as you do Geralt (as far as the main story is concerned). Not only that, she's tremendously more powerful than Geralt is.\n\n* Ciri is not an \"unrealistically gorgeous\" female, unless you're going to try and say that she's portraying women should all go out and get bad-ass scars on their faces in which case I guess I'd have to concede that point. She isn't running around doing back-flips with double D's. She doesn't wear revealing clothing, and she's got the same \"dirty\" look that the rest of the (non-Sorceress) characters in the game do.\n\n* **WITCHER 2 SPOILER** Speaking of sorceresses: there's a coalition of extremely powerful women who (at the end of Witcher 2) damn near took over the entire Northern Kingdoms with the end-game of taking over the world. Here we have a bunch of bad-ass chicks that no one is walking on top of, until the end at any rate when their plot is exposed and the entire Northern Kingdom begins a crusade against *magic,* not women.\n\n* **MINOR WITCHER 3 SPOILER** At the point in the story I'm at now, Ciri is not a sexualized character - *at all*. The one dialogue I've seen where it was implied things might get sexy... well, let's just say it doesn't. Hell, there's one point where all the females she's surrounded by are in the nude but her \"naughty bits,\" tits included, are still covered which to me says the developers were actively trying to ensure that you, in fact, *don't* sexualize her.\n\nWhat am I missing here? Why is Witcher 3 being lumped in with the anti-womyn games like it's the old-fashioned Tomb Raider with Laura Croft's lack of personality and basketball sized boobs? Am I just not looking in the right places to see this point of view? Or is it just that a couple mainstream Feminists are making a big stink over nothing, as it seems?\n\nSo, in summary, the Witcher 3 falls more into line with Feminism than most video games that have come out thus far and Feminists should embrace it, not shun it. Change my view.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: I think an insurance company only for elite drivers is a great idea", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_383u0b", "selftext": "I believe that there exists a great market for auto insurance that only insures elite drivers.  Personally, I have never made a claim in the 17+ years that I have been driving and paying auto insurance and I believe that I should be paying a lot less than I am.  If I had the money to invest, I would start an insurance company that requires the following of all policy holders, no exceptions:\n\n1) No less than 10 years of driving experience.  \n2) Zero at fault accidents in at least 10 years.\n\n3) Zero claims filed with your previous insurance company in the last 10 years.\n\n4) No moving violations in the last 7 years (eliminates one third of fatalities*).\n\n5) No DUI or felony driving convictions, for your lifetime (eliminates one third of fatalities*).\n\n*http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/How-many-accidents.aspx?WT.qs_osrc=fxb\n\nI understand that the qualifications are somewhat subjective, but I don't see a fair way to avoid that.  You could say that you are still a very low liability if you have only 1 speeding ticket for 5 mph over the limit 6 years ago, but that opens the door for a guy who has 2 tickets.  You have to draw the line somewhere.\n\nTo answer some likely questions: if you are on a policy and do something that causes you to no longer , the claim is paid but your policy is cancelled until you meet the requirements again.  No, you cannot add your teen driver to your policy, no matter how great you think they did in driving school.  Yes, your spouse is listed as an excluded driver if they do not also meet the requirements. All others are listed as excluded drivers.   \n\nI believe that enforcing the above would drive down claims enough that rates could be drastically reduced.  The main people who are opposed to this would be those who are butthurt that they don't qualify.  That's just too bad.  This is a (hypothetical) private company that has the right to refuse service to those who do not meet its qualifications, just as other insurance companies do.\n\nThe following is just an observation that I tried to backup with data but I have not found anything.  It does not seem to me that car accidents are evenly distributed.  It seems that some people smash up their car every couple of years and others have never caused such an event.  As such, the requirements are intended to disqualify about 90% of the people on the road today, and offer insurance only to those who have consistently demonstrated a high skill level and good judgement.\n\nI believe many good drivers would flock to this service because they are tired of spending their money on a service they have never needed to use and have a very low probability of using in the future.  This is not a service for everyone, but for those who qualify I think it could add a lot of value.  To CMV, you will have to convince me that this is not a viable business idea.  You will not CMV with responses that state any version of \"I'm a good driver but I don't met X, and I think I'm special and should still be able to be insured thru this company.\"  Thanks.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: If gay and interracial marriage is legal in a state, then polygamous marriage should also be legal in that state.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3836eq", "selftext": "A few things to note before a start:\n\n1. I'm not arguing to the contrary against gay marriage. I am for gay marriage as I am for polygamous marriages.\n\n2. I'm not arguing for forced marriage or arranged marriages where several women are forced to marry a single man, like in various religious sects, but the concept of a marriage containing multiple people as a whole.\n\n3. I am as much for polyandrous marriages as I am for polygynous marriages. (i.e. women can have multiple husbands in addition to men having multiple wives.\n\n4. Willing to discuss this *legally* and *ethically* in seperate spheres, but let's try not and mix the two together too much, unless absolutely necessary. It is assumed that gay marriage is both legal and ethical for the purpose of this discussion. If you believe gay marriage should be illegal or is unethical, then those arguments have merit towards polygamous marriage as well.\n\nAlrighty, now onto my main points.\n\n1. Polyamarous people deserve the same right to equality, to marry who they love, just like homosexuals, and heterosexuals. Polyamarous relationships are no less moral than homosexual relationships, and relationships between consenting adults should be able to be consummated in marriage.\n\n2. Marriage was not made legal by a popular vote in many places. The only country to legalize it via a popular vote was Ireland a week or so ago, everywhere else had it decided by judges or representatives. In the US, interracial marriage and gay marriage has been ruled as legal by courts, not voted in. Public opinion towards polygamous marriage is irrelevant.\n\n3. When it comes to raising children, one can assume that since having a single parent results in worse-off children, then having a higher amount of parental figures and providers would make for a similar, if not better child-rearing than having one parent, two parents, or two parents of the same sex (all of which are legal). [Source] (http://archive.news-leader.com/article/20121125/NEWS01/311250054/single-parents-Ozarks-poverty) [Source 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_House)\n\n4. When it comes to insurance, legal proceedings, etc. everything can be easily adjusted to treating additional spouses as additional dependents (as where such institutions are adjusted for additional children). Yes, it is true that the current system does not allow for it, but it can be adjusted. When it comes to division of property, divorce, etc. things will simply be divided by the amount of people participating in the marriage, i.e. if there are three people, everything gets split 33%, or if the other two remain married, it gets split 66%. Prenuptual agreements can take care of anything that may be complicated by this if spouses have different intentions for how things are split. There will be a cap where insurance coverage/tax benefits end, i.e. if you have more than 7 children you stop receiving benefits for any more. For taxes and insurance, children are treated similarly to spouses, and additional spouses shouldn't complicate things out of reason. The specifics as to what the cap will be, how things get split, life and death decisions, etc. can be hammered out by individual states and individual people participating in a marriage, just like in other marriages.\n\n5. Sham marriages containing two people that don't love each other, of the same or different sex are currently legal. *Chuck and Larry* marriages are currently possible, the only difference in allowing polygamous marriages would be to not allow odd numbers of people to participate in such marriages, rather than being in pairs. The difference here is insignificant.\n\n6. The idea that polyamarous people are treated \"equal\" because *everyone* is only allowed to marry one spouse is the same type of \"equality\" where *everyone* is only allowed to marry within their race or sex. This is nonsensical. Everyone being held to the same standard of law does not work when people love people outside of what is socially accepted.\n\n7. Polyamarous relationships aren't any less stable than homosexual relationships or heterosexual relationships. Even if they were, it shouldn't have any weight, as interracial relationships are much less stable than intraracial relationships. To argue that polygamous marriage shouldn't be allowed because of a instability in relationships is also to argue against interracial marriage.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That isn't to say that children cannot consent, just that the consent isn't considered to be consent in law. A child can consent to anything with regards to their bodily integrity but there is quite rightly a standard in law which protects children against certain things. \n\nFurthermore, in a situation where a child instigates or freely consents to sexual activity instigated by another person it can be said that a child's bodily integrity is violated by any law which prevents them from engaging in that behaviour.

{"title": "CMV: There is no such thing as \"always offensive\". Context and intended meaning are everything.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_382a0i", "selftext": "I recently posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAVufRsalw0) in a thread. I just meant it as a jokey response to someone's comment, but some people took offence to it. Apparently, because the actor playing the character isn't black, that makes this blackface and therefore unacceptable and offensive.\n\nTo offer some context, this is from a show called facejacker which is a follow-on from fonejacker. Fonejacker was a show about one man making prank calls and playing characters. You never saw his face. Mostly what you got was the audio from the conversation and an animated still picture representing the character [like this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA3zhzT1wDo). So, the blackface character in the video above was developed for fonejacker. It's just meant to be an amusing accent that plays off people's image of a \"Nigerian scammer\". Because he was such a popular character, he was brought back for facejacker. The concept of facejacker was to take some of those characters and turn the actor into them with make-up so he could go out and prank people face to face. So, the character came first. It's meant to be funny and it's meant to play off certain stereotypes people have, but it isn't racist and shouldn't be taken as such.\n\nThis is one example of many. I just think that only context and intention of the author can determine if something is racist or not. I also believe that we should be moving towards a world where a black actor can play a white character and a white actor can play a black character and no-one cries racism because racism just isn't an issue anymore.

{"title": "CMV: Being quick to anger and violence is a mental illness or disability, and we should be more proactive about getting it treated if we see its symptoms, and preventing it occurring", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3822j7", "selftext": "Often in life, and on the internet, I see people who see violence or anger on a personal level (I would rather not discuss things like wars or gang violence, which have other issues in play) as a solution or immediate reaction to a problem. On a personal level, I cannot fathom how such a person could reach adulthood without being institutionalised or requiring severe therapy in order to control these emotions.  \n\nOur emotions *inform* our actions, but they should never *control* them. I might get irritated at being cut off in traffic, but I would never start cursing out and gesticulating at the driver in front of me - because I rationally know that this will have zero effect in correcting the problem currently being faced. I might get pissed off when I start losing an online game, but I don't start abusing other players, or physically breaking my computer or punching a wall - because that would result in me materially losing, not gaining. So such a person who *does* do such a thing should be considered mentally disabled or ill, as they are taking actions that don't benefit them for only the most minor of catharsis - it's just another flavour of self-harm.  \n\nA simple Google search of \"anger mental illness\" backs up my views, with many anger-related mental health issues. It's even in the public consciousness, with movies like *Anger Management*. Yet somehow, domestic violence continues to be a problem - so somehow, these mentally ill people aren't being caught and somehow believe that violence is ever an acceptable response in an adult life. Even shouting matches still occur despite the fact that any rational adult should be able to carry out a calm conversation and either keep themselves under control, or withdraw if they feel they cannot.   \n\nSo the short version of the CMV is: Being quick or accepting of violence and anger is already partially recognised as a mental disability/illness, but we're not doing enough to combat it. As a global society, we should be more active in teaching children that it's literally never OK in standard adult life (self-defence being the only exception), and if we ever see it in adults, we should be quick to recommend them to therapy in the long-term, and ask them why they feel anger/violence is acceptable in the short term when any sane person would know it's the wrong thing to do.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, in the exact same way that pain associated with other surgical procedures I have had under general anesthesia as an adult does not exist because I cannot remember it.\n\nThe WHO currently recommends male circumcision for HIV prevention and \"as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package\".  It is primarily recommended in areas with high incidences of HIV, but given its demonstrated effect at reducing the spread of the virus I prefer to have any added protection possibly available.  I would plan to infer the same protection to any hypothetical children born at this time, especially considering that the complication rates here are significantly lower than in the areas where it is most strongly recommended by the WHO.\n\nLiving in the midwest U.S. it is culturally nearly expected, with 70-80% prevalence.  Because of this, many to most potential sexual partners in my area (including myself, as a gay male) prefer the aesthetic of a circumcised penis.  With the research consensus demonstrating no adverse effects on sexual performance, I see no reason to not stick with the cultural norm. \n\nWhat may help change my view:\n\n* *Scientific studies* demonstrating prolonged psychological damage due to infant male circumcision.\n\n* *Scientific studies* demonstrating that complication rates and severity in the U.S. outweigh potential benefits due to HIV resistance.\n\n* *Scientific* evidence that circumcised males in the U.S. are demonstrably less satisfied with their sex lives than uncircumcised males.\n\nWhat will *not* help change my view:\n\n* \"People should be allowed to chose\".  Parents are wholly responsible for their children's health and well-being until they are capable of making those decisions on their own.  Circumcision complication rates increase dramatically with age.\n\n* \"If everyone stopped doing it, it wouldn't be culturally expected anymore.\" Yeah, not going to happen any time soon.

Very curious to say what the responses are!\n\nJuveniles are given special treatments in trials, there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life,\n\nTrying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience?\n\nEDIT:\nI think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1].\n\nAlso, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an adult more logical, but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation isn't generally a happy thing, and often due to poor circumstances... more rehabilitation would likely make sense, but I see how it would be logical for a system.\n\n\n[1] http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24173194 \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Affirmative action doesn't help in the US anymore.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_37y19g", "selftext": "With affirmative action dictating that a certain amount of students or workers have to be either women or an ethnic group that isnt white(or in the case of a few places there has to be a certain percentage of every race and sex including whites and males), it shuts out individuals who would be more qualified for the position, and so wastes resources, and reduces the quality of goods and services from companies that uphold affirmative action.\n\nNot only this, but it puts the \"beneficiaries\" at a disadvantage in education and the workplace.  for example, if you took two students from the same class, where student A barely passed with a low C, and student B  was at the top of the class with an a, then accepted student A over B just because of the color of their skin or whats between their legs, student A isn't exactly going to do well. As put in [this](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21576658-first-three-pieces-race-based-preferences-around-world-we-look-americas) article, student B isnt very likely to be able to keep up with the rest of the class due to them lacking something the other members that got there through merit rather than just being handed a position in the class for their race or sex. This in turn can damage their confidence, and waste their time and money they could be otherwise using to actually progress in life rather than being given a shortcut only to find that they cant keep up, or in the case of them getting into a service or production position, the customers of said person will be getting a shoddy good or service thanks to affirmative action.\n\nedit:nvm, i jumped into something without researching properly.\n\nedit: after looking into it more, it doesnt look quite as bad as i had initially thought, but even so, if it comes down to two applications being identicle aside from the applicant's ancestry, its still a pretty shoddy idea to just assume that because you share ancestry  with the majority of the upper class that your actually a member. there are plenty of whites squatting in rundown trailer parks while other whites live it up with the upper class. at this point my stance towards affirmative action depends on where and how its implemented. so long as it does what its actually supposed to, i agree with it now. though with how states have different laws, and how massive of a board there is to monitor, theres bound to be at least a few iterations that operate closer to what i had initially thought and what oversoul mentioned\u25ec"}
{"title": "CMV: When minorities complain about cultural appropriation it in itself perpetuates racism and self segregation.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_37xfke", "selftext": "I see black friends complaining about cultural appropriation lately, my issue is the hypocrisy of it all.

{"title": "CMV: It is very difficult to oppose financial abortion while remaining logically consistent. Most people who oppose financial abortion hold other positions that are logically inconsistent with said opposition.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_37x74t", "selftext": "By financial abortion (FA), I mean that men could choose not to be forced to pay for children they do not wish to raise (could only be done pre-birth, ideally pre-conception).\n\nMany people oppose financial abortion. However, it seems to me that it is extremely difficult to oppose financial abortion without using logically inconsistent, and therefore invalid, arguments.\n\nWhy are arguments that are logically inconsistent invalid? For example, suppose I stated that it's wrong to eat cows as food since we do not need to kill animals in order to meet our nutritional needs. I then state that it is ok to wear leather jackets. We can see that this doesn't make sense - it is logically inconsistent. So it must then be dismissed, unless I can resolve the inconsistency.\n\nThis is different than mere hypocrisy, which does not invalidate an argument. Suppose I said that people should not smoke, because it is bad for your health. I then admit that I smoke a pack a day. My statement is hypocritical, but that is irrelevant since my argument is still just as strong or weak regardless of whether I am a hypocrite or not).\n\nIn order to oppose financial abortion while still remaining logically consistent, one must also hold a great deal of other beliefs, which most people do not.\n\nWhat do I mean? I'll explain:\n\nSuppose I stated that children are entitled to support from its biological parents. Therefore, FA is wrong.\n\nHowever, those who believe this must also oppose sperm clinics to remain logically consistent. Children born from sperm clinic donations are not entitled to support from their father. But most people have no objection against sperm clinics. Note that under this argument, it doesn't matter if the mother is a multi-millionaire. If a child is obligated to support from its parents, that does not change regardless of the wealth of its mother. \n\nIf we then made the argument that \"the reason children are entitled to support from their parents because most mothers are not rich enough to support it themselves. So it's ok for women to sue sperm clinics if they can support a child on their own.\" - then we would have to agree that men should not be forced to pay child support if the mother is rich, in order to remain logically consistent. Yet this belief is not popular.\n\nIt also means that you must believe that male rape victims - both boys and men - should be forced to pay child support. After all, they are the biological parent. However, most people do not support this.\n\nThis usually leads to an argument along these lines: \"male rape resulting in a kid is quite rare compared to consensual sex resulting in a kid. Only people who consent to sex should be forced to support resulting children.\"\n\nHowever, if you support this argument, then you must also oppose adoption or abandonment, as they currently stand. A woman who adopts out or abandons a child (which was from consensual sex) is not forced to support it.\n\nThe common rebuttal to that is something like \"If neither biological parent wishes to raise the child, then it is fine for neither of them to be forced to pay. Adoption means someone else agrees to raise and support the child.\"\n\nBut wait - didn't we say earlier that a child was entitled to support from its biological parents? If so, then they are entitled to that support whether only one parent wants to abandon responsibility, or both parents do.\n\nMoreover, not all kids given up for adoption are taken in by families, particularly older or non-white ones (in America). Many remain in foster care indefinitely. Therefore, one would have to believe that the parents of children who are not successfully adopted should be obligated to pay for them. But I have never seen anyone put forth this argument.\n\nAnother common objection to financial abortion is that without forcing men to pay, we would have to increase welfare to prevent kids from living in poverty. And that should not be done because it would burden the taxpayer.\n\nHowever, a poor man and woman who have a child would also have this burden. Many people do think that poor men and women should not have children, but most do not think there should be any legal consequences for doing so.\n\nAlternatively, a poor woman is perfectly entitled to have one-night stands, and not tell the father if she becomes pregnant. She may then move to a different city, have the child and go on welfare. \n\nI do not see anyone claiming that women should not be allowed to do this, even though this is also a burden on taxpayers.\n\nOf course, it is quite possible to have logically consistent arguments against financial abortion. For instance, I could state that financial abortion should not be allowed, because I think that men, as a class, are obligated to give money to women as a class. With that argument, it would be relatively easy to maintain logical consistency with other beliefs. However, that is not a common argument, in my experience.\n\nIn order to change my view, I could see two things:\n\nConvincing me that positions such as opposing sperm clinics or agreeing that male rape victims must be forced to pay are widely-held among those who oppose financial abortion. Perhaps some surveys showing that large percentages of people oppose sperm clinics under their current usage, for example.\n\nProviding some reasoning that would make it logically consistent to state (this is just an example) that \"parents are obligated to support their biological children\" and \"it's ok for a woman to use a sperm clinic although the father will not be supporting the child.\" This seems quite difficult however.\n\nNote: **Please don't give me reasons as to why financial abortion should or should not be allowed. The thread is about the logical consistency of opposing financial abortion with other beliefs, not about whether FA should be allowed or not**."}

{"title": "CMV: Apples are better than oranges", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_37ven4", "selftext": "You always hear the saying, \"it's like comparing apples and oranges,\" in a way that implies that it's silly to compare. This is false though and I would like the chance to prove to you that apples are the better, more versatile fruit.\n\nAlcohol: drinking is awesome and fun. Rarely do you hear about anything orange though, outside of being a garnish or in liquers. Apples are the full feature alcohol fruit that can come in cider or wine form, as well and being used in the same fashions oranges could, liquers and garnishes. No one orders an orange wine because they just aren't common, and that's because they aren't very good! Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that.\n\nFood: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage.\n\nDiversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. \n\nJuice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal. Apple juice also comes in carbonated form commonly. That's pretty cool.\n\nPop culture: the technology company Apple owes most of it's success because of the apple, spwcifically McIntosh apples. If macs were called \"Navels\" or \"Valencia\" instead would Apple have been so successful? Not a chance orange fans, sorry to burst your bubble. Also Forrest Gump's infamous line, \"life is like a crate of apples...\" Would never work with oranges due to lack of variety. Lastly, there's no Johnny Orangeseed, check and mate.\n\nLove to hear orange fans change my mind though, let's see it.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

In many jurisdictions it seems, it is possible for the state to prosecute these teenagers on child pornography charges to same extent that it could prosecute a paedophile pornographer taking pictures of a nude 10-year-old.  This seems absurd, but what I find especially egregious is the fact that *teenagers can be prosecuted for possessing nude photographs of themselves that they themselves took*.  Obviously, I object to this, and I have two bases for my objection:\n\n* Photography of one's body by oneself reasonable falls under bodily autonomy, and [minors, especially adolescents, have been found to have at least some right to bodily autonomy.](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3805&amp;context=dlj)\n\n* I believe that something being criminal necessitates an actual or potential injury to a third party, and the concept that the subject is the victim in child pornography does not apply here because the subject is a first party to the producer/possessor.  \n\nDistribution is another issue entirely, complicated by things like iCloud and the NSA, but I don't think that possession in all cases necessitates distribution.\n\nMuch of this just occurred to me now, and I realize that there's probably a hole in my logic or a point I'm missing somewhere, so please change my view.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Yes, but they will be our children.\u201d - Marvin Minsky*\n\nSo firstly, this stems from a view that if humans are ever to survive into the far future (maybe even only a few millennia), it will be by integrating ourselves with technology and shedding our fragile organic bodies.\n\nWhat is the maximum typical lifespan of a sentient organic species? Humans have gone from the invention of writing to the capability to destroy our entire species in just 5,000 years. On a cosmic timescale, that is an instant. Will the Earth still be inhabitable for us in our current states by the time another instant passes? Luckily, we\u2019ve already started primitively engineering and augmenting ourselves, with genetic modification, prosthetic legs, hearts, ears, etc. The technological advances in just the last 100 years (as well as the damage we\u2019ve done to our planet) has been incredible\u2014 what will the next 5,000 bring?\n\nLet\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that the nearest sentient species developed on a planet 100 lightyears away. (Just FYI, a quick Google/Wolfram Alpha search tells me the fastest human spacecraft now being designed will go 200km/s, which means it would traverse 100ly in 150,000 years.) Let\u2019s say that, just by chance, this alien civilization achieved our current level of technology very near to us in time\u2014 only 10 million years ago. Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization. And organic life forms are just not well-suited for interstellar travel.\n\nEssentially, I think organic life is a means to bootstrap into existence truly immortal technological \u2018life\u2019. This is true on Earth and on every other planet as well. And just by the nature of cosmic timescales, it\u2019s much more likely to come into contact with the next evolutionary stage of an alien species than to be lucky enough to catch it in the minuscule period while it\u2019s still fully organic.

Engineering projects aren't like that.\n\nWe would not admit a function that doesn't produce the correct result sometimes, and the researcher would not tell us to restart and try again. A function can't be mostly right or \"good enough\". It's either correct or incorrect. Maybe if we considered programs correct or incorrect, we would not release incorrect programs.\n\nIf we worked like this, probably we would not be able to release as many programs as we do now.

It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise.\n\nI would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the $599.99 store than the $600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary .99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition.\n\nTherefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned.\n\nI can see how that might cause problems with prices like $19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference.\n\nIf you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations. But it would at least call for some sort of consumer action or boycott.\n\nAnd if you believe this is too small of an issue to write laws or organize rallies against, then that's also fine, but then you at least have to admit that this is still completely undesirable and dishonorable, at least on a miniscule scale.\n\nYou would probably change my view if you present a convincing central reason for stores to do this that isn't purely manipulative.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Since these missiles exist and are proven to be effective, I have to question why the jaeger is necessary. Why can't these missiles be fired from ships, vehicles or airplanes? \n\nI understand that kaiju are evasive and fairly quick for their size, but we already have cruise missiles that can travel at over mach 7, and targeting systems capable of hitting targets far faster, more evasive and smaller than any kaiju. \n\nInstead of, say, attaching these effective warheads to cruise or ballistic missiles, we instead build gigantic, expensive, hard to crew, hard to produce and frankly not that effective robots. \n\nThat's not even mentioning the plasma cannon, which could also be employed without the Jaeger.

The purpose of the problem is to present a dilemma between utilitarianism (benefitting the most people in the best way) and deontology (doing one's duty in life as in following basic principles), but I do not believe that doing nothing and allowing the 5 people to die is ethical under either mindset.

They are everywhere, blowing around, getting in the water, and animals eat them.\n\n\nIm sure the main counterpoint to this is going to be \"how can you or the government tell me what i can do with my body and health\"...\n\nThey already do though. They pass laws all the time because they say it's for our own good. Seatbelt laws for one example. The only person you hurt by not wearing one is yourself, but they make that a law. They have laws about what toxins and chemicals can be in our bug sprays, paint, and food, so it isn't like they dont already do that.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: People who are \"saved\" by suicide hotlines aren't legitimately suicidal; they just have poor crisis management.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_37nl1w", "selftext": "Edit: To clarify, I don't mean to say that the type of people with poor crisis management aren't at risk for killing themselves; by \"legitimacy\" I'm talking about how valid the wish to die is in the first place. I also don't think that crisis hotlines are unnecessary or should be eliminated, because they very obviously help people. Those who are legitimately suicidal as I'm defining it in this post are those who actually want to die, and have a rational reason for doing so, rather than simply acting on impulse or using death as an escape from an acutely stressful situation. The duration of time that someone has a suicidal with isn't necessarily indicative of whether their wish to die is legitimate or not, but I think that having time to consider a decision and its alternatives generally helps with rationality. I also don't intend to claim that depression is a necessity for being suicidal or \"legitimately suicidal,\" although I'm sure it increases the likelihood of being so.\n\nAlso, downvotes don't change views, people. \n\n***\n\nI've suffered from very severe depression for most of my life, and have considered suicide quite frequently. One of the things people like to throw out is contact information to suicide hotlines, but they've never been helpful to me.\n\nMy personal experience aside, I really don't see how these crisis hotlines could help someone who legitimately wants to die (as opposed to someone who uses suicide or self-harm as an escape from acutely painful emotions or a stressful situation). If you were set on dying, then why would you want to call a hotline like that in the first place? I think that if someone wanted to die, they wouldn't commit suicide on an impulse in a moment of crisis; they would do research and try to carry out suicide in the most effective way possible with the least chance of error. Calling a hotline is also not going to change any of the external factors that would lead up to someone being suicidal. Perhaps they would help the person consider their issues in a different light, but again I think that's evidence of poor stress management.\n\nI can't make any statements to whether or not my personal suicidal wishes are \"legitimate\" or not because there is always the looming possibility that my mental illness is clouding my judgement to some extent, but I think that it's theoretically possible that someone would want to die on a rational basis. I also don't think that suicide hotlines are generally helpful for the chronically depressed, but that's only tangential to my main argument. Once you're mentally ill for a long period of time, (I think the issue of mental illness and consent become very clouded, if for no other reason than it's impractical to deny someone consent for the majority of their lives because of a mental health condition.) It seems like the wish to die in and of itself is a basis to claim that someone is not acting in their right state of mind, which I think is illogical and unfortunate. \n\nI know this paragraph was written somewhat messily, and I apologize for that. I'm just trying to provide some context for my view. I will be happy to clarify anything for anyone that asks.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

My friends often are criticizing me, saying that I'm just afraid to talk about issues on race and gender, although I find myself to be very liberal.\n\n I think people are just afraid to admit this idea of social inequality in a capitalist world is far too out of their control because of the power dynamic that the elite have set for hundreds of years, and that they think they can really change something by focusing too much on the gender or color of a persons skin to explain their problems, and not the socioeconomic situation they are stuck in. Some inner cities are essentially ghettos and class mobility and the \"American Dream\" are now more or less impossible to achieve in my opinion.\n\nI should note I have divorced parents, one who struggle on a single income and one who was very successful financially so I've had the \"tale of two cities\" on the subject.

{"title": "CMV: Under capitalism, the wealth of the \"rich\" works to the general benefit of everyone.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_37ir7g", "selftext": "It is my belief that the great majority of average people's opinions about economic policies are predicated on a central false assumption: that the wealth of the \"rich\" provides only a private benefit to the \"rich\" themselves. Or, if people recall the basic lesson of economics that, in a free economy, wealth is not zero-sum, they still dramatically underestimate the degree to which the wealth of the \"rich\" benefits not just the \"rich\" but everyone in society.\n\nThe fact that people believe this can be seen in virtually any reddit thread on political-economic debates. There are the usual cursory dismissals of so-called \"trickle-down economics\" (itself a pejorative term for supply-side economics). There is the condemnation of income inequality and the call for redistribution. There are the constant demands for more government intervention into the economy and allegations that the cause of our economic and political troubles is lobbying by corporations and the \"rich\" for policies that benefit only their class interest.\n\nThere are two separate lines of argument here: the economic and the political. The economic argument is that the rich are \"hoarding\" too much wealth, which is no longer finding its way to the common man. The political argument is that the lobbying of the rich is the cause of governmental \"cronyism\" and special-interest politics. I think the political argument has more of a kernel of truth than the economic, but they are both utterly off-base.\n\n**The Economic Argument**\n\nWhy is it somewhat natural for the naive person to think that the wealth of the rich benefits only the rich? It's because the average person thinks about where the great majority of *his own* wealth lies: in consumption goods. If I've got food in my refrigerator, you can't eat it. If I've got a car in my driveway, you can't drive it. If I've got a bed in my house, you can't sleep on it. Consumption goods provide a private, exclusive benefit which only one person (and perhaps his friends and relatives) can enjoy.\n\nBut the wealth of the rich does not consist exclusively\u2014or even predominately\u2014in ever-larger piles of caviar and champagne. If it did, then it really would just be wasteful \"hoarding\", and calls to stop it would be rational. On the contrary, however, the wealth of the rich consists predominately in *capital goods* and in claims to wealth such as bank deposits, stocks, and bonds, which are claims on wealth loaned out almost exclusively to businesses for the carrying-on of production.\n\nThe **fundamental** point to realize is that capital goods\u2014as with productive spending in general\u2014provide *no special benefit* to their owner in their capacity as means of production. As means of production, they provide a *general benefit* to everyone. The only special or private benefit derived from means of production is the ability of their owner to exchange their proceeds for consumption goods, instead of reinvesting the profits into additional capital goods.\n\nFor example, does the ice-cream man's truck provide him a private benefit? No: it benefits all the children who are willing and able to buy ice cream from him. Neither does the gas with which he fills the truck or the additional ice cream he buys to restock his inventory provide him a private benefit. The only private benefit comes insofar as he decides to sell the truck or use the profits not to buy more gas and ice cream, but to buy consumption goods for himself.\n\nThe same goes, on a larger scale, for a company like Toyota. Do Toyota's factories only benefit the shareholders of Toyota? Obviously not. They benefit everyone who is willing and able to buy a Toyota, by making those cars available to him at a lesser cost. The only private benefit to the shareholders comes insofar as they decide to use their dividends not to buy more stock, but to spend them on consumption goods for themselves.\n\nFrom the opposite direction, it is necessary to address the \"broken window fallacy\", which is extraordinarily common when dealing with questions like this. Many people, apparently having taken the lesson that wealth is not zero-sum too far, think that **consumption** provides a general benefit to society\u2014and therefore that we should encourage as much of it as possible. This is not the case.\n\nFor example, take the purchase of a Ferrari, which is a consumption good. The naive view is that this \"creates jobs\" and is therefore good for the economy. The fact is, however, that the Ferrari represents, from the point of view of society, the consumption of wealth. In other words, it is the *destruction* of wealth. Yes, it transfers some wealth from the buyer to the Ferrari company and its employees, but it is a *net loss.* The engineering talent and factories which made the Ferrari could instead have been allocated toward the production of industrial machines and trucks which contribute to further production.\n\nNow, this is not to say that we ought to ban Ferraris or other forms of consumption spending by the rich. They are necessary as an incentive to produce, and innovation in the form of toys for the rich often results in technologies that have wider application. But there is no need to \"increase demand\" or \"stimulate consumption\": we already have enough *needs* in the world; what we need is more *supply*, more ability to produce.\n\nThe connection to this to the point about the general benefit of the wealth of the rich is: contrary to most people's assumptions about \"trickle-down economics\", the rich do not benefit society insofar as they frivolously spend or give away their fortunes. (I really do think this is what many people think: that tax cuts for the rich are supposed to be good because it will encourage them to be more charitable or maybe buy a few new Ferraris.) Rather, the more parsimonious and Scrooge-like a rich person is\u2014the less he spends on personal consumption and the more he saves and invests into productive enterprises\u2014the greater does his fortune benefit society.\n\nAnd that's the essential point: the world's richest people may control a large share of the total *wealth*, but they do not spend nearly as much of that wealth on *consumption* as does the average person. Now, if the goal of leftist movements were to decrease the amount the rich spend on consumption and make them save and invest more, it would at least be understandable (if unwise). But the desire to increase *corporate* and *inheritance* taxes or, worse, have a *capital* tax could not be more counter-productive. These represent the taxing of wealth which goes almost exclusively toward production and which therefore provides a general benefit to everyone.\n\n**The Political Argument**\n\nI will deal with this much more succinctly, since it is less complex. It is observed that our political system grants all kinds of special favors to connected companies, such as corn, sugar, and ethanol subsidies. And reddit is always blowing up over the Trans-Pacific Partnership and similar deals which grant special protections and favors to certain companies.\n\nBut do such deals exist because of the lobbying of the rich? Absolutely not, when you turn to the question of the fundamental causes. No company could ever stand up and say that, purely out of naked greed for the unearned, they demand that the American people subsidize them. They come in on the grounds the socialists and interventionists have already prepared for them: that the government has to step in and intervene in the economy for the good of society. They merely argue that the good of society is achieved by interventions on their behalf.\n\nNow, of course, each individual voter cannot take the time and effort to lobby for the *general* interest, as opposed to the special interest of a cronyist company. There is the familiar problem of concentrated gains by the special interest and diffused costs of the general interest.\n\nThe weapon of the individual voter is the principle of *laissez-faire*: that he will not tolerate *any* intervention in *any* case, and that he will vote out any politician who votes for such an intervention. But it is precisely this weapon which the dominance of interventionist economic ideology takes out of his hands.\n\nThis is all to say: cronyism does not exist as the product of lobbying by the rich for their class interest. It exists because the average voter *believes* in the philosophy of the mixed economy and the welfare-regulatory state. Cronyism is simply the inevitable consequence of the concentration of economic power in the hands of the state. If one wants to stop money going into politics, one must take away the power of politics to control the flow of money.\n\n**TL;DR: Everyone benefits from the wealth of the rich, insofar as they spend it on production. The cause of political cronyism is not wealth inequality but the concentration of economic power in the hands of the state.**\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.\nI believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.\n\nI understand that the state assumes the right of the child &gt; the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.\n\nOr on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.\nObviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.\n\nTL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.\n\nEDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice\", however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.\nEDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood\". \nTheScamr worded this nicely:\n&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.\n\nEDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

You cannot believe in evolution as well as the Christian genesis story because they directly contradict each other.

Beyond that, if you claim that Christian genesis is just a metaphor because it isn't actually true in a literal sense, then you can further extend that the entire bible isn't true in a literal sense.\n\nIf someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true, then that person has effectively filtered the bible themselves.

{"title": "CMV: Mechanical Engineering is not the place for me", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_37htd2", "selftext": "So, I've been studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alabama for a little over a year. I am a sophomore by hours, but this is my third semester.\n\nThings aren't going as well as I expected. I passed Calculus 1 by the skin of my teeth, and got a D- in Calculus 2, resulting in me being stuck here for a summer semester. \n\nAs far as career goals, I want to go firearms industry, but I have some specifics. I don't want a desk job. Flying a cubicle is my nightmare. I want to have a product. I like hands on work, with a physical result. I hate theory.\n\nI have always been fascinated by machining(look at /r/machiningporn, every link is purple for me) and I've grown to love watching the 3d printers at UA.\n\nIn that light, I fear that ME won't put me where I want to be. Looking for co-ops and internships for this summer(before I bombed calc), everything was for a desk job. I would've either been an R&amp;D researcher, or working with Solidworks in a cubicle. I don't want to get shoehorned into an air conditioned job and be unable to get my hands dirty.\n\nOne class I have this summer, Intro to Private Security, seems very interesting. The professor is engaging, and his topics intrigue me. The textbook reading is equally fascinating. I'm really getting into this.\n\nI feel like I'd be better served by transferring to a community college and getting a Certificate in Machine Tool Technologies and becoming a machinist, or going for a job in the security industry. Both would be fairly interesting to me, I think. Machinist would get me an inroad to major firearms maker as a CNC operator, or assembler(which would be awesome), and Private Security would involve some interesting work with firearms.\n\nSo.  Change My View."}

{"title": "CMV: The Jesus Myth Hypothesis is Plausible", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_37h2pb", "selftext": "Crossposted from a comment on /r/skeptic\n\nI've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of vitriol on both sides. The mythicists take umbrage at being dismissed as amateurs and dabblers and vociferously defend their hypotheses, the historicists take umbrage at the strenuous attacks, and it all gets very torrid very quickly, and becomes very difficult to actually analyze the actual strength of the arguments.\n\nSo, as a skeptic, I'm sufficiently intrigued by the Mythicist arguments to profess agnosticism as to the Historical Jesus, for the following reasons:\n\n* There are no extrabiblical attestations of any significant event from the life of Jesus. On the contrary, events such as the slaughter of the innocents, the census of all the Empire are clearly fictitious, and multiple miracles, the triumphal entry to Jerusalem, and multiple events surrounding the crucifixion are absent from all historical records when there's a reasonable chance that some account of them would have survived, had they occurred at all.\n*  The synoptic problem indicates that we are working from at most one source that even approaches being primary, and even that most likely written much later, anonymously, and as hagiography rather than history.\n*  Well into the third century, pagan sources mostly recount the existence of Christians and document the claims of Christians. This is at best hearsay.\n* attempts to reconstruct the \"real\" historical Jesus are invariably unprovable and contradictory with one another--there is no consensus.\n* While the vast bulk of NT scholarship presumes an historical Jesus, the \"scholarly consensus\" should be given less weight since for centuries, such research has been largely a devotional undertaking. Jesus mythicism is very nearly literally heretical, as well as figuratively. At least sufficiently that it deserves consideration even though a strong consensus exists that contradicts it.\n\n\nSo, we accept the historical reality of many persons throughout ancient history based on much less proof than gospels and various other pagan mentions. So maybe there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition. But the problems above mean A) we know nothing about him and B) almost everything written about him is unknowable or outright fictitious.\n\n\nI look at it as the difference between \"Abraham Lincoln\" and \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\" Notwithstanding that there is an historical person that was the basis, the hero version is a myth.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you look at the primary issues in a case of Body Dysmorphia it involves a person not satisfied or sometimes even disgusted by their current physical body.  This often leads them to making surgical corrections to feel more comfortable with themselves.  Isn't this the same as a person who is Transgendered?

{"title": "CMV: I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_37gq9y", "selftext": "Please note before reading: Please do not downvote my comments and replies on basis of disagreement. I've done several CMV's where I was the clear minority in terms of viewpoint, and got downvoted on nearly every post. Due to Reddit's karma system, this makes me wait a period of 7 minutes in between replies if my karma is low, and makes it more difficult for me to respond to everyone (the more karma you have, the less time you need to wait to post). If I act like a dick to you, act irrational, or say something logically fallacious, I implore you to downvote me, but I'd really like to be able to discuss with everybody and not be held back by my inability to reply (and consequently hear replies).\n\nOkay, onto my view. I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens, for the following reasons.\n\n1. I don't necessarily \"have nothing to hide\", but I don't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook (or what porn I look at). I have some personal things I wouldn't want an actual person to know or look through, but I feel entirely comfortable with a machine using a CTRL-F function to search for terrorist activity, or other organized illegal activities since I don't commit any major crime. I know a lot of people are worried about the government seeing people torrenting things illegally or watching movies/shows illegally on the internet, but considering how widely this is done and how nonexistent people are prosecuted for it based on the governments ability to view all this, I'm not worried about it. I don't do drugs, but if I did and tried to buy drugs over FB or text, I doubt the government would even care. We have /r/trees for instance, thousands of people openly doing minor illegal things and the government doesn't care enough to try and arrest them.\n\n2. I remember hearing during Rand Paul's filibuster that there has been terrorist activity stopped by government spying on people. I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. I also heard during the filibuster that the government was using spying to take down organized crime. I'm not worried about that, considering I'm not involved in organized crime and therefore am not worried about it. (I'd like to point out here, that it's not really a view regarding sympathy or empathy towards criminals and what rights they should have to privacy, but simply my *feeling of worry* about being spied on). I don't view the NSA spying on druglords to be much different than wire taps or undercover officers.\n\n3. In addition to the above, I have the view that Islamic extremism is, as of ISIS' international attacks (or extremist Muslims inspired by ISIS at least), a legitimate threat to the United States. There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications. They have claimed to have thousands of people in the US, and while that may be an exaggeration, I don't believe it to be unbelievable considering they have had 150 individuals that have travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS (Source: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/25/american-foreign-fighters-isis_n_6753854.html). I would expect if many people are willing to take the trouble to travel to another country to fight others, it's not unexpected that they more would stay in the US to try and perform terrorist activity here considering it would be easier.\n\n4. I'm not worried about the government knowing my political views. I broadcast them publicly on Facebook, and considering our country's devotion to free speech as well as multiple political parties, I don't view any dissent to be any threat to my well-being.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've noticed tons of people talking about how bad it is, how they are going to take shorter showers, etc. But then those tend to be the same people who \"eat local\" and love these restaurants that serve all locally grown produce / meat, etc.\n\nThose local farms are, in many cases, growing crops that require an incredible amount of water compared to the amount of food they produce. I understand that there is a complex issue here, and I'm not saying they should all stop growing rice overnight, but I certainly don't feel *good* about eating locally grown produce anymore, and I don't think it should be seen as such a great thing in light of the drought.\n\nLocally grown food may be superior  because it is fresher, or because it doesn't use as much gas to ship here, etc. But I don't feel good about consuming produce that is contributing to the water shortage, when we could be getting it from places that aren't in a drought.\n\nIMHO, the whole \"locally grown\" craze should be replaced with \"grown with responsible water usage\" or something like that. Of course that isn't trivial to define, but that's a problem for another day. I'd love to support local farmers that were growing crops well suited to the terrain.\n\nEdit: wow, tons of replies this morning! I'll be busy for a few hours but I'll get to them\n\nEDIT2: Thanks for all the discussion this has been great. Some more details:\n\n* I live in Northern California (San Francisco)\n* I don't have a great definition for \"local\", but let's say within 50 miles. I may have mentioned international before, but the real \"local food\" thing seems to be around 50 miles, e.g. not mega-farms in the central valley\n* I'm considering all food products, produce, dairy, meat, etc.\n* My main hypothesis is that by avoiding \"local\" and instead going for \"water efficient\" (which may, in some cases, be local), we encourage local farmers to care more about water usage than they otherwise might, and that this is a good, helpful thing. So my actual view is that always supporting \"local food\" is actually making the water shortage worse because it is encouraging poor distribution and usage of water.\n\n\nSome things that could convince me:\n\n1. The carbon footprint of bringing in produce from further away is worse, short and long term, than the extra water usage\n2. Local water usage isn't actually a problem, or its only mega-farms in central valley that are a problem (also related to different watersheds, which someone below brought up), in which case other benefits (supporting the local economy, etc) make it positive\n3.

We've seen this in movies like Terminator, Days of Future Past, I Robot, and the recent Age of Ultron. But it isn't just limited to science fiction. \n\nElon Musk and Stephen Hawking have both said that we should be very cautious about creating AI. That it could be \"the last invention human kind ever develops.\" I think pragmatically it is always reasonable to proceed with caution. After all introducing foreign life to a new eco-system is something that rarely ever goes well for the existing creatures there, and as Toffler said in \"The 3rd Wave\" \"the invention of a new technology always precipitates the need for a new war.\"  \n\nWith A.I it is reasonable that we practice caution and be concerned about what we're doing because we're developing both a new technology *and* introducing a new species to an existing ecosystem. So my view is **not that** we *shouldn't* be cautious. \n\n**My view is:** When you boil down what people are actually scared of when it comes to robots or AI, we're not scared of something *new* and *unknown* happening. Far from it. We're actually terrified of the  same old same old. **IE** The robots will treat *all humans everywhere* the same way we (as a species) routinely treated *some humans in some places.*  They won't want to co-exist but rather dominate. They won't borrow from us or adapt to us but destroy and replace us. We're scared of them acting like that because if we were them, that's exactly what we'd do.  \n\nMaybe our fears are based on projection, we're just scared they'll do what we would do. Or maybe we know the next phase of evolution would be an arc that leans toward peace and we're scared that in order to learn that they'll have to wipe us out. \n\n"}

It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. \n\nHowever, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. \n\nSimply put, I find this phrase (\"respect is earned, not given\") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: \n\n1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.\n\n2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.\n\n3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing. \n\n4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\". \n\nAs such, I think one would be better served by the idea that \"respect can be lost\" rather than \"respect should be earned\".

In 2012 Brelo was part of a chase that ended with over 130 rounds shot into two unarmed suspects. Brelo fired continued to reload his weapon, climb on the care, and fire another 15 rounds in the car, after other officers had already stopped firing. The judge ruling over the case cleared him of charges using a baseball analogy and saying it was impossible to prove his bullets were the fatal shots. Although this is true, the use of force was excessive and he was still, nonetheless, a party to this grotesque undertaking of \"justice\". \n\nThis case highlights that police can operate according to a separate set of laws. If I was with a person who fired one shot into a person and killed them, despite clear evidence I did not shoot the fatal shot, I would likely still be charged with murder, at the very least accessory (or an equivalent charge) to the murder. Even in a case of clear self defense, one is almost certain to face criminal charges, especially when they continue to use force after the threat has been eliminated and they are in no clear danger. For example, If me and three friends fired 140 rounds into a home invader you can be certain we would all be in jail. Though it would be close to impossible to prove who's shots were fatal, we were all participants, and we would still face severe legal consequences.\n\nIf we as a society accept the idea that people are justified in using lethal force in self defense, it should not be also accepted that certain people, because of their job, are able to follow a different set of guidelines. \n\nSo Reddit, in order to help me deal with my anger at the moment, I hope you can convince me that in a nation where \"no man is above the law\" which prides itself on the idea of \"liberty and justice for all\" that some people, because of their job, should be allowed to be \"more equal than others.\"\n\n(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/23/michael-brelo-not-guilty_n_7427710.html)\n\n(http://www.businessinsider.com/judge-john-p-odonnell-explains-why-michael-brelo-was-found-not-guilty-2015-5)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Ideally, all exam papers should have a 'tap out' option where students can ask for a 5 minute 'fresh air' break or something similar. The purpose of this 'tap out' option - and the suggested break time above may not be the best system, but it's just off the top of my head - would be to allow students suffering from a brain freeze, panic attack, stress moment etc. to take a breather. From personal experience many students experience these terrifying ARGHHHHH HELP moments during exams, and I feel that in many cases, a short break and an opportunity to stand up for awhile would really clear the mind. \n\nPossible objections include: \n\n- Ease of cheating. Yes, but an extra invigilator could follow the student out or simply have someone standing in the hallway. \n\n- It's not fair, disruptive, etc. Yes, but ideally the student would be able to raise his/her hand (just like if you had a crazy stomachache) and be escorted quietly out. Also, not too many students would take advantage of this system IMO. \n\n- Extra thinking time: I don't believe that the 5 min 'tap out' should be counted in the exam writing time as this would discourage anxious/stressing students from making use of this option. I also think that it would cause more stress to students who would already be freaking out about not finishing the paper. In my opinion, 5 minutes extra for an exam should not be causing so much difference in terms of performance; if students are working to the last minute, the time limit is 1) too tight or 2) they simply don't know the material. \n\nI would really welcome thoughts on why this is not a practice and suggestions as to why this current suggestion is not a good idea/is a good idea.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: A minimum wage increase will hurt the poor and the economy, not help it.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_374p4i", "selftext": "Over the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or in the process of mandating a minimum wage of ~$15/hour. While on the surface, this seems like a good policy for strengthening the poor/middle class I believe this will ultimately HURT, not help the public, and especially the poor. \n\nHere are several common arguments made in favour of the raising minimum wage and my response:\n\n* \"Average wages haven't increased despite an increase in production and profit in the economy\"\n\nIt's a common misunderstanding that wages are/should be directly tied to production. In reality wages are determined just like prices of anything else, through supply and demand. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled and easily replaceable (through either humans or automation) making the supply of labour far larger than the demand, which equals a lower wage. The rise in technology that has resulted in higher production from labour has little affect on wages. \n\n* \"Current minimum wages are so low that they do not pay a livable annual salary, keeping the working poor in a perpetual state of poverty\"\n\nI would challenge the idea that most minimum wage jobs were ever meant to be sustainable for living. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled labour (ex. factory work, assembly lines) or service industry jobs (cooks, janitorial staff, retail jobs etc..). At least to me, these seem like temporary work done by people in the process of finding higher paying employment (students, recent graduates, new immigrants etc...), and not intended as a career at all, so a livable wage is not required. \n\n* \"A higher minimum wage would increase the income of many in the population, boosting spending, saving and the overall economy.\"\n\nAs I said previously, the vast majority of minimum wage jobs are easily replaceable, outsourced or automated. If large companies are forced by government to pay high minimum wages, they will seek cheaper alternatives and replacements instead. For example, a McDonald's hamburger could very easily be made faster, cheaper, cleaner and better by a machine, [like this one, which makes a burger every 10 seconds ](http://www.businessinsider.com/momentum-machines-burger-robot-2014-8). If the minimum wage gets high enough that it costs McDonald's more to pay 10 people to flip burgers than one machine, they will simply replace the human labour altogether. This will result in an increase in unemployment. So while those who retain their minimum wage jobs will be better off, many will simply be replaced, leaving the unemployed workers in a WORSE position than before. \n\nHere are some things that would change my view: \n\n* Research evidence that demonstrates positive impact from countries/states that have already raised minimum wage\n\n* A justification that the minimum wage must be a \"living wage\"\n\n* Evidence that a wage increase would not result in the loss of unskilled jobs to outsourcing, automation etc...\n\n* Any other reasonable justification of minimum wage\n\n\nPlease change my view!\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The simplest, cheapest, most effective way to improve society would be encouraging and participating in more public interaction between strangers", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_373dh6", "selftext": "I am not here to make an exhaustive (and certainly biased) list of what I believe is wrong with society/culture (specifically in America, where I live), but to suggest that all the issues could be moderated (if not necessarily solved) by establishing new attitudes and behaviors in public spaces and around strangers. It seems that my generation (recently dubbed, by some, the Oregon Trail Generation, existing between Gen-X and Millennials) was the first to be raised with explicit \"stranger danger\" warnings and programs like DARE, latchkey centers, etc. Since then, the stigma against strangers has only increased and our default attitude turned closer to fear and suspicion.\n\nIt would take a long time to dissect the various causes for this notable shift but at least some are clear: Modern media more constantly and sensationally depicts the negative potentials (often real, but sometimes illusory). The rapid growth of the internet and technology has given negative individuals access to our private lives and information (think 419 and phishing scams). A more connected and globalized society has shown us a greater number of negative outcomes (even when those numbers do not reflect a higher percentage or likelihood).\n\nI'm certainly not blaming technology for this, as the way we use it exists in a complex cycle of innate habits/desires, the capability of the technology, and a reinforcing feedback loop. Many of the issues are, however, exacerbated by technology because it gives us the ease to disseminate fear-based messages (which are naturally stronger than positive messages) and provides us with a secluded alternative to the public sphere. We can easily find people who agree with us, information that fulfills our search, and interactions that provide some positive stimulus without ever having to interact with strangers.\n\nThat said, the insular world we have created puts incredible distance between individuals even as it purports to bring us closer together. While it is wonderful that a person can find a community that shares and validates their unique interests, we are relieved of the burden of having to consider and integrate difference. Further, these habits have not only stratified society economically but subdivided it in all directions. For all the openness of the modern world, we are actually strengthening in-groups by creating social networks and dating sites that cater to race, religion, profession, etc. (I've been looking for research to support this statement, but precious little has been done.)\n\nAs I see it, nearly all of these issues would be alleviated by reinstating the public sphere as a place for interaction between strangers. I'm not saying you should talk to every person you see out and about and we definitely need to educate vulnerable groups/individuals on keeping safe (and have a police force capable of adequately and appropriately handling the situation). We could begin simply by discussing the arts when encountered in a public setting (ask a stranger what they thought of a movie instead of just your friends) and discussing news in public forums (why can't people in Boston Common have a conversation about the recent trial?). We should be more open to finding all kinds of relationships randomly, whether on the subway or in the grocery store. \n\nObviously, there will be lots of discomfort and inconvenience. You shouldn't talk to everyone, all the time, and it will take each individual an amount of trial and error to gauge what is and isn't appropriate. Still, the general outcome seems to be only positive. For most of the us, the worst outcome is encountering more annoying people, but I actually think \"wait til you hear about this guy I talked to at the gas station\" is more interesting than \"I went to the gas station and listened to this podcast that confirmed what I was already thinking.\" We would also be afforded new (that is, old) ways of dealing with issues that arise from online dating and MRA/SJW/etc. communities.\n\nMany people will chalk my attitude up to a rural midwest upbringing as a white male. No, I did not grow up in an area where gangs, drugs, etc. were likely encountered on any sort of regular basis; no, I was not at risk of racial or sexual harassment and related violence. I am, though, familiar with those experiences second-hand (my university had students from 35 states and 42 countries, so I was exposed to an extensive array of different cultures/attitudes/experiences) and actually believe my solution may alleviate them to some extent. A portion of perpetrators (admittedly the ones likely to do the least damage) may change their attitude and behavior because of their increased interactions with others. The worst offenders are likely to attempt/commit their actions regardless. Potential victims may actually gain allies and confidence from increased interaction (one specific ex: women who become comfortable approaching and speaking with men in public are more likely to find men who don't just want sex/dating and the women will demonstrate that they interesting, complex, equal people rather than just joining online groups intent on telling us they are interesting, complex, equal people).\n\nAm I really miscalculating the ratio of benefit/danger? Is there some insurmountable barrier to public interaction I'm not considering? Is this happening more often than I realize but just not in my area? \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That's very similar to what a lease is.\n\n1. **Suze Orman, very rich lady and personal finance guru, hates car leases in all situations.**  [If anyone ever brings up the topic of leasing a car, she just gives them a Suze Smackdown.](http://www.suzeorman.com/resource-center/suze-orman-money-tips-video-collection/lease-or-buy-a-car/) \n\n2. **People lease cars so they can afford to drive something they cannot buy.** \"You're spending money you don't have to impress people you don't know,\" Suze says. You should go to a used car lot and find something you can own for the same payment as what you would lease. It might not be that hard, the first owner took a 20-30% hit in value as soon as he took ownership. You might find the car 2 or 3 years old and you can buy with the same money. \n\n3. **When you look at the details, it just doesn't add up to a good deal.** You have to come up with a large down payment, pay monthly, and at the end of it all, you own nothing. To re up your lease, they expect another large down payment *for a car you already have*. Their are milage restrictions. \nOnce I knew a guy who lived in Detroit and wanted to go to Chicago for the weekend, but was afraid to drive his car because he calculated that his daily commute was going to put him very close to or slightly beyond the mileage limit by lease end. \nYou're paying monthly for a car that you can't drive whenever you want because they're going to charge you $.25 per mile over the limit. If you go 3000 miles over (which could happen in one road trip) that's $750 you have to pay *just to give the car back*.  Oh and you're also paying through the nose for any dent, ding, bump, stain or scratch in the car. \n\n\n\nUnless it's a company providing a company car for business purposes. Your employer isn't in the business of owning, servicing and managing vehicles for the long term so a lease makes sense for them.

Second, the sheer population destiny (humans are bad with big numbers). For instance, Guangdong, which has at times been called the factory of the world is a province less than half the size of California, yet has a population equal to that of 30% of the US. That's like taking every person from Texas to the west coast and putting them in California south of Fresno. \n\nOther issues such as over-fishing, which Japan is far more guilty of, and not to mention that a lot of the Chinese seafood is exported to the west.

My hypothesis is that extreme racial/cultural difference (Skin Color, Mutually Exclusive Religion, Colonial Grievances, etc.) between populations leads to self-segregation, behind-the-back othering/scapegoating, and lower interpersonal trust on average - the foundation for a socialistic society where all are to be treated equally. You might be willing to do business with the other group, but god forbid your family invite them over or get intimate with them. As long as visibly different groups with past antagonisms exist, people will judge members of the other group differently, at least with no other information available. \n\nI suspect the primary reason right-wing parties against the EU and Social Democracy are on the rise, is due to lower interpersonal trust brought on by 1.) The Continuing Employment Slump and 2.) Immigration, particularly from Africa and the Muslim world. As the economy continues to slug along in the midst of austerity, the natives are feeling a tad powerless, with the lower classes having to compete now with immigrant labor - leading to scapegoating and resentment.

One thing I'd really like to see in this CMV is a compelling case for an anthem in a language I don't know.\n\nMedia links are, of course, welcome.\n\nJust to get a bit out of the way, why did I pick *Oh, Canada*?\n\nFirst off, singability. (I don't think that's a word.) OC stays with just a few notes in a pretty narrow range. For this reason, the \"off-key crowd\" effect which is so noticeable with songs like TSSB, especially when you're *in* the crowd, doesn't really affect OC so much; Crowds sound pretty good singing it.\n\nSecond, excellent lyrics. Thematically, there's not much for even the prickliest of political malcontents to object to. You could be an atheist and object to the appeal to God in there, but if I were an atheist I'd just think of the word in its explitive form when I sang it. There's no reason for religious hang-ups to ruin national anthem fun, especially if one is an atheist.\n\nI suppose that pacifists might object to the statement \"we stand on guard,\" but if you're talking about your *home*, it seems that even an extreme pacifist would want to stand *some* kind of guard, if only just to know when to run away.\n\nThird, and finally, I think that it's the best national anthem because it's so much fun to sing drunk. (That's like 85% what national anthems are for, after all.) The way it builds to that boisterous climax ... Just genius.\n\nBefore you disagree, just give *Oh, Canada* a sing once you've got a snootful. It's pretty good. Way better, I'll reluctantly admit, to TSSB.\n\nSo, CMV."}

As I see it, there is no advantage to me placing my bid early.  An early bid gives any other buyers more time to evaluate my bid and possibly outbid me.\n\nMy plan for auctions is usually to figure out the maximum amount I am willing to bid for an auction, and then submit that offer as close to the closing time of that auction as possible.  I don't rebid.  I might bid a few hours early if I know I will unavailable at the exact close of the auction, but I never bid several days in advance.\n\nIs there something I'm missing?  I often see a large number of bidders on items throughout the week, and I'm not really sure of the point.\n\nNOTE: I understand there are other types of auctions (Buy it Now, Dutch Auction, etc) where this strategy might not apply.

I never understood why it was considered polite to say \"bless you\" after someone had sneezed. \n\nFrom my understanding, because people believed sneezing was a demon being expelled from your body, they would say \"bless you.\" Nowadays, that doesn't really make sense, and I doubt that anybody believes that is the reason people sneeze. \n\nNow I don't really care if people prefer to say \"bless you\" after they hear someone sneeze, but it's absolutely ridiculous that some people actually get upset, and will even go as far as calling someone out for not saying \"bless you\" after they'd sneezed. They simply had a tickle in their nose and their body was getting whatever particles it didn't want in the nose out. \n\nSome may say that it's similar to saying \"excuse me\" when they burp, fart, or yawn, but I disagree. Saying excuse me is a way of apologizing for being a disruption, while saying \"bless you\" is a silly way of saying \"I acknowledge that you have sneezed.\" \n\nSaying \"bless you\" doesn't make sense, and while it doesn't hurt to say, I shouldn't be ridiculed for refusing to congratulate someone on their sneeze. It becomes more disruptive than the sneeze itself and it's just silly. \n\nPlease, please CMV.

She found out she was pregnant from that encounter, the couple married and the husband treats the baby as if it were his biologically. There were so many butthurt comments asking if the couple had ever told the biological father about the baby, asking if he had a say in the matter, etc. The mother actually had told the bio dad that she had gotten pregnant, apparently he wasn't a great person. What I don't understand is why being biologically related entitles a person to a child's life. If the argument is \"You did it, your responsibility\", there shouldn't be a problem because there's already a father willing to take the responsibility. I'm not talking about sperm donors, because it goes with being a donor that your involvement includes sperm and nothing else. I mean, if the man had wanted children, there are a lot of ways he could have them- naturally, adopting, surrogates, etc. He didn't have sex with the woman with the intention of having a baby, so why should he be considered as anything but a genetic relative? If I sneezed on a stranger and found out a year later they had somehow had a baby from my sneeze cells, what right would I have to get angry and demand involvement and power over decisions in its life? The thing that's most confusing is that the people getting angry over biological rights are mostly people without religious or supernatural beliefs, so why are they under the impression that sharing DNA creates an emotional bond? I understand there are holes in my stance, and I have nothing against biological parents or any kind of surrogacy, step parent, foster situation. I just genuinely don't understand what reason people have for believing this way.\n\nAfterthought- Perhaps a clearer title would be \"Being biologically related shouldn't grant any parental or family rights/involvement.

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books and loved them even more. Now, when I watch the new episodes or go back and watch those ones I initially liked it feels different. \n\n* The show now seems like a rookie film students first attempt at portraying the book. The acting, budget, and sets all seem fine. Things like staging, dialogue, character's appearances and the plot's movements seem very obvious and amateurish. \n\n\nAt first I played it off with rationale like, they have budget issues, or it's just harder to portray these complex scenes on television, or that they needed to shorten the storyline to fit it in a ten season show.  Now I am starting to feel like the show's creators are really just amateurs. They are using the \"best\" books in the last two decades so of course the show is popular. But if someone without their rapey suckage had control, could it be that much better?\n\nPlease change my view so I can enjoy the show again. \n\n**I think to accomplish this someone has to either just absolutely school me on film knowledge or make me feel good about the fact that they didn't have a choice for toning basically everything down. Maybe I'm asking too much, if so I apologize.\n\nTranslations of my words for clarity.\n\nRapey suckage - using sexual violence in ways that seem to be more geared towards shocking the audience than furthering the plot. I'm actually thinking more of the rape scenes for Dany and Cersi.\n\nStaging - there is no subtly to the character's positioning in frames. As someone who is only a casual film observer I prefer a show like Breaking Bad where I have to watch it a second time to finally be able to see the importance of things like a character's positioning on camera. GOT seems amateurish when compared.\n\nDialouge - too many corny phrasings and catch phrases (especially when they use modern idioms). I am currently trying to find a script online so I don't have to transcribe scenes to give you examples. They also do a poor job introducing characters and have to make up for it by having character's say their own names all the time\n\nCharacter's Appearance - Why can't people have the long hair and beards they are supposed to? Legolas had hair down to his waist and he was still a sex symbol. I know Tyrion can't really have his nose chopped off but their first casting or Daario left my head spinning.\n\nPlot's Movement - Given that they are cutting half of the books out there shouldn't be so many complaints out of non-book readers that the show is boring. Or is the general public just that impatient?\n\nEdit 3 - added a question mark\n\nEdit 4 - Maybe this context will help someone to see another angle to change my view to. I have a cousin who watched the show and read all the books who insists the show is better than the books but never gives me reasons. What could his argument possibly be?\n"}
{"title": "CMV: Reddit's \"hive mind\" is creating a cycle that encourages unoriginal content rather than thoughtful comments", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_36ty1x", "selftext": "I have this opinion for a while now. I feel that Reddit is slowly becoming a place not for thoughtful comments or discussion, but rather a website for obtaining worthless internet points with unoriginal content. Even without considering submissions, I have found the comment sections to be very frustrating. I know that Reddit (occasionally, and often jokingly) acknowledges the \"hive mind.\" However, this seems more as a means of allowing the user to seem not a part of the hive mind and therefore unique, rather than actually criticizing it and attempting to fix the problem. \n\nFor instance, on a recent post pertaining to the Columbia rape ordeal with the girl carrying her mattress around, the link directed to an article with pictures of posters around the university claiming the girl is lying. There was no evidence or even speculation in the article that said she was/wasn't lying. However, in the comment section for the post, almost every single comment was able how terrible the \"liar\" was and how she deserved it. I immediately thought her claim was proven false, as everyone was so adamant. A quick google check did not confirm anything, except that there is not enough evidence. I did not even bother to comment explaining this, as previous commenters who deviated away from the \"witch-hunt\" were downvoted to oblivion. I am not making a comment on the actual event. As there is no evidence, I feel that I cannot assert that she was or wasn't raped. I know that the concept of false-rape accusations against males comes up quite frequently on Reddit. I completely agree that these claims can seriously hurt and damage an individual's social reputation and mental health. I don't have a problem with that. It just seems that Reddit has become infatuated with this concept and is making claims without any evidence; which is a bit hypocritical given the situation. Anyone who dares to voice their opposing opinion is immediately drowned out.\n\nI realize that not all of Reddit is like this. And of course, I will admit that I have been caught in the moment and contributed to some degree. However, I feel that a large portion is caught up in the hive mind and is not even aware of the issue. Please change my view. Thank you.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While this is true, it fails to mention that admissions in those schools is extremely competitive. Meaning only the best students attend college and only the best of the best attend graduate school. The result is those with a college education are somewhat rare. This is fine because their high school (and vocational) system make it possible to be economically successful without college. \n\nHere in the US a BS degree is rapidly becoming what a high school diploma was to previous generations, the basic level of education. Anyone with a halfway decent high school GPA can go to college in the US. If money (or a willingness to take on debt) is no longer a way to \"Gate Keep\", lower tier public Universities will be forced to drastically raise standards or close their doors (such as where I went, East Carolina University). This will make getting a BS degree must more difficult (especially for those coming from a failing public school district).

{"title": "CMV: Ads on Hulu are no different from ads we've gotten on cable TV for decades, and people who complain about it are just spoiled.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_36p7k9", "selftext": "This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding.  For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for large bundles of channels that you might not even want.  Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have offered a great way to circumvent that process at a much more affordable price and are completely changing the way we view content.\n\nAnd yet I still see so many people getting so wound up over watching ads on Hulu.  My perception of their argument is this: \"I pay for Hulu, so I shouldn't have to see ads.\"  Maybe I'm over-simplifying it, but I just haven't seen any other viable argument that really says anything beyond that.\n\nNow, I should say I definitely understand hating ads.  I live in the city, and I can't walk ten feet out my door without someone trying to sell me something.  We are over-saturated by advertising and it's awful.  Thankfully with more options to block advertising on the internet, it's forcing advertisers to create ads that are more entertaining and feel less obtrusive (although, sometimes it does also force the opposite).\n\nBut even though I hate advertising as much as a lot of people do, I still recognize it as a vital part of what makes television work, and since I really like being able to know what happens on my favorite shows every week, I don't get my panties in a twist over it.\n\nI see a lot of people getting wound up who have little understanding of how a service like Hulu works.  I'm certainly not an expert either, but I have an understanding of how the licensing process works and how expensive it can be.  Netflix may be able to get by without ads, but Hulu offers something that Netflix doesn't: content from television that is current and has recently aired.\n\nNetflix usually won't provide new episodes of a show until an entire season is finished.  And even then, it might be a few months until even that happens.  The only current content they do have is their own original programming, which they can get away with because they own the licenses and don't have to pay any licensing fees or performance royalties to any outside production company.\n\nI've seen a lot of my favorite shows on Hulu have episodes be online just hours after it airs on live TV.  Since I dropped cable years ago, this is one of my favorite things about it.  I don't necessarily like that advertising is part of my subscription, but I also realize that Hulu has to license this content from production companies, who have had a history of being apprehensive when it comes to embracing changing technologies.  They are likely charging much higher licensing fees and royalties which means that Hulu in turns has to find other sources of income beyond subscription fees in order to make it work.  Not to mention that the networks themselves probably have their own fees since they probably have exclusivity deals with the production companies who make the programming.\n\nPeople are so quick to jump to the \"X company is a bunch of greedy corporate whores\" argument without understand the major complexities that go into making a service like Hulu work.  I'm sure Hulu is well aware that their subscribers don't like watching ads.  \"I don't like watching ads\" is even an option in their survey when you cancel your account.  People went on the same tirade when Netflix raised its prices, and I remember thinking the same thing then.\n\nI think that people's displeasure with advertising will ultimately shift services in the direction of removing advertising, but I still think that's a long way off.  Streaming services, despite being around for several years now, are still in their infancy in a lot of ways.  It's going to take a while to allow everyone to adapt and a lot of companies will be resistant to it in the hopes they can retain their old business models.  But I don't see any of this as the fault of Hulu for using advertising.\n\nSo my real curiosity here is to find an argument against Hulu's advertising that I haven't seen.  I see so many people upset about it, but I feel like my only understanding of their argument is that they're spoiled and don't want to see ads, which I recognize can be straw-manning on my part.  I'd like to see if someone can shift my bias and provide me some insight I'm not aware of.\n\nEDIT: /u/ceader is the one who ultimately changed my view.  I'm still kind of skeptical about some people's criticisms towards Hulu, but I'm definitely more understanding of why people don't want to pay for ads.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: It is impossible to be a true Christian and support the actions of the United States.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_36olkz", "selftext": "First I think I should make all the clarifications I can.  By \"true Christian,\" I mean someone that does their absolute best to live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.  A \"true Christian\" actively analyzes his or her own behavior and actively attempts to better themselves based on Jesus's teachings.  And by \"behavior,\" I specifically refer to relationships with others, social interactions, lifestyle, and actions over words. \n\nBy \"support the United States,\"  I want to refer specifically to U.S. foreign policy and action, specifically the current/recent wars in the middle east.  Also think about matters such as:\n\n-support of the state of Israel (not condeming it's terrible actions) \n\n-CIA/blackops/paramilitary operations around the world\n\n-backing of dictators and tyrants because they do the bidding of corporate interests\n\n-use of torture\n\n-use of drone strikes\n\n\n\n\n\nI was raised as a Christian (ECLA Lutheran) and although I am now an agnostic, the moral teachings of Jesus and Christianity have not left me.  Here is my understanding of Christianity and the teachings of Jesus, and I will also say that every civil, intelligent conversation I have had about religion has ended with these same conclusions:\n\n-Everyone should try their very best to follow the golden rule, the second commandment, or whatever you want to call it:  \"Love thy neighbor as thyself,\"  \"treat others how you want to be treated,\" etc.  It's a pretty universal moral code amongst humanity, but is specifically important to Christianity\n\n-People are not perfect.  They commit sins.  But if you try to live your life to the best of your ability following the golden rule, to care for and love others as yourself, and confess your sins to be forgiven by Jesus/God, then you will be saved.  You can get into all the ins and outs of the \"resurrection,\" but when it comes down to it, the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus is to forgive the sins of those who attempt to live good lives and sincerely admit/confess their sins.  If you don't actually mean it and feel remorse, it's meaningless.\n\n-God is love, submit yourself to the will of God, humble yourself before God, you are nothing compared to God, love God with all of your heart, etc.\n\nHere are some relevant Jesus quotes:\n\n\"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.\"\n\n\"But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.\"\n\n\"For what shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul?\"\n\n\"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.\"\n\n\"I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\n\"For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.\"\n\n\"Give to everyone who begs from you; and of him who takes away your goods do not ask them again. And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.\"\n\n\"All the commandments: You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and so on, are summed up in this single command: You must love your neighbor as yourself.\"\n\n\"For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?\"\n\nNow the main reason why I disaffiliated myself from Christianity can be best described by a quote of Gandhi: \u201cI like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.\u201d  That and I realized there is a high probability that Jesus did not actually exist, at least as we fantasize him as having supernatural powers.  But the teachings and moral code of Jesus/Christianity is an entirely separate entity that exists outside of any supernatural belief.  And it is this observation that makes me ask why/how the United States can call itself a Christian nation and do the things it does?  Or you substitute \"Christain nation\" for \"morally superior\" or some other similar term.  I think it's a fairly prominent belief here that \"we are the good guys,\" so whatever we have to do to maintain our power and lifestyle, we are absolutely justified in doing.  But how can you be a true Christian, and actively support that?  That seems to directly contradict the teachings of Jesus in so many ways.  Please prove me wrong.  And please provide specific examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n"}

As much as I would like to simply not listen to singles, it's just too tempting when I've been craving new music from a band for two years.\n\nI think artists should instead release a couple of teasers, that way people can get a taste for the sound of the new material, but without being completely exposed to a full song and potentially ruining the experience.\n\nI also hate the current trend of streaming new albums a week before release dates. It really kills the anticipation, and it sucks when I pre-order music and everyone who didn't gets to listen to it early. If you crack and just listen to the stream, then you won't be as excited to listen to your copy for the first time when you finally get it. \n\nObviously I don't expect record labels to try to enforce either of these ideas - *ever* - but I wish it would become the new trend.

{"title": "CMV: My public school's diversity education was actually racist.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_36o9ws", "selftext": "I went to high school in the 1980's.  In a small town in the Northwest, U.S., that was very white, (OK, all white), where basically everyone was Christian.  I would like to think that the school curriculum was chosen with good intentions.  Except looking back on it now, I really don't believe that.  I would like to believe that, except I don't.\n\nSo for English in tenth grade, we had novels assigned designed to promote diversity and an awareness of injustice against other races.  \n\nTo teach us about the problems that black people historically faced in America, we read a book called \"Black Like Me\".  The book, \"Black Like Me\" is about a white man who colored his skin to appear black and went down South in the late 1950's.  The book chronicles his (fairly awful) experiences.  \n\nExcept thinking about it now, there must have been hundreds of thousands of black men in the South during this time period.  If we wanted to know what it was like, why didn't we just ask one of them?  Did we really need to send a white man down pretending to be black?  Was that the only way to get a legitimate opinion?  It doesn't feel right.\n\nThen we have the holocaust, and our assigned reading was \"The Hiding Place\" by Corrie Ten Boom.  Which is about two Christian sisters sent to a prison camp for attempting to save Jewish people.  Now don't get me wrong, what they did was incredible, but is it really the best way to teach students about the holocaust with a book written about the suffering of Christians?  Something very crucial seems to be missing here.  It's not like there was some shortage of books written by Jewish people.\n\nSo I would like to change my view.  I would like to think that everyone had the best of intentions.  In retrospect, it just doesn't feel right and doesn't seem right.  Who the heck would choose these books and why?  \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrie_ten_Boom\n\n \n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically many more people are killed by other forms of energy generation (I believe!). That's not to say that this isn't a worry, on some level. It's just not my top worry.\n\nI am, however, concerned about nuclear waste. The goal of developing alternative energies, to my mind, is to reduce our environmental footprint and save our ecosystem as we know it. Sure, we might slow global warming using nuclear energy - but to my knowledge, we don't really have any good way of dealing with nuclear waste. Investing in nuclear energy is just a way of trading one environmental problem for another.\n\nSecond, other forms of renewable energy are increasingly cost-effective and efficient. There's no reason to be generating nuclear power when we can do just as well with other forms of energy.\n\nThird, nuclear energy is an international conundrum. If we could move away from nuclear energy in the United States and invest globally in other forms of renewable resources, we would be able to prove, in some small way, that nuclear energy programs are unnecessary - and, therefore, give us more leverage to refuse to tolerate them in diplomatic talks.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Price gouging during natural disasters is a good thing, and should not be banned.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_36nvdo", "selftext": "This came up in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy for me, since I live in an area of NY (Long Island) that was fairly heavily effected.\n\nAfter the storm, generators and gasoline were in very high demand and very short supply.  Due to [NY's price gouging law](http://www.ag.ny.gov/price-gouging), gas prices rose only very modestly after the storm, and many gas stations had incredibly long lines.  Generators were basically unavailable at any price.  \n\nIf price gouging had been allowed, the high prices  would have had two effects, both beneficial:\n\n* The price would have attracted needed items from outside the effected area to come in via unusual means.\n\nNormally, gasoline was delivered by pipeline.  But due to the flooding, the main pipeline terminals were knocked offline.  If gas had been, say, $6 a gallon in NY, every gasoline tank truck in the Northeastern US would have started heading there full of gas.  On a 2500 gallon truck, you could make $5000 per trip by hauling in gas from Binghamton or Boston.  And I think most tank trucks are even bigger than that.  Likewise, every generator along the eastern seaboard would have been heading for the area.  Because the price wasn't allowed to rise though, there wasn't the monetary incentive needed to get people to do crazy things to overcome the logistical challenges.\n\n* The higher prices would have caused people to conserve.\n\nPeople panicked when they thought supply of gas might be unavailable.  They'd flock to any open station and have huge lines, even if they had enough gas in the car to last a few days.  When the price rises substantially, it will make people conserve more, and leave what's left for people who really need it and are thus willing to pay the temporarily higher prices.\n \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

(I think this allows so many scientists to be religious.) \n\nChange my view that 1. God could reveal Himself that way, and/or 2. that such evidence could be trusted (assuming a reasonable, intelligent, otherwise perfectly healthy, open-minded individual). \n\nI'd also be interested to hear argument against whether a God *would* do this, although I suspect I've heard it all already, and it just comes down to what kind of God He'd be. \n\nI'd prefer to debate this somewhat objectively, because it is a dearly-held belief. I saved a girl drowning when I was 8, brought my sister back to life when I was 12, and I watched that same sister undergo literally dozens of surgeries to keep her both alive and healthy, despite doctors misdiagnosing and ignoring problems. The coincidences I encounter almost monthly seem too extraordinary for chance. I'll get hung up on a particular phrase, or re-experience a vivid memory, only to have it be key to my work or some great aspect of my life... Individually, they're nothing signifiant, but put all together... I am a scientist and a statistician, and I just can't see how odds like this couldn't count as *some* degree of evidence. \n\nEdit: Slight change to view, or a more accurate understanding of view - rather than basing the value of each personally significant coincidence purely on the (un)likelihood of it happening randomly, I would rather it be weighted by the correlation of a) the amount of personal significance the event held at the time, and b) the unlikelihood of the event occurring randomly. I may not be using the correct terminology, but one when a datum is only considered strong evidence if the conditions are met at the proper ratio. Hopefully someone understands? \n\n(I may be tired or obtuse, but this is tricky to think about and put into words. Please bear with me and I muddle through.)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, I view it as something that is \"good while it lasts,\" meaning that I will use it until it ends but when it does end will see that it had too. \n\nIt is sort of like when a store wrongly prices a product and I can by it cheaper. I will by the product, but when the store realizes and corrects the prices I come to the conclusion that the prices were wrong and the correct price is 100% fair. To mer there is no debate on whether the lower price was fair; it was not! In order for the store to make a profit and employ workers they need to have the correct prices. Also if they dont correct the price they may have to stop selling the item from the manufacturer and that may cost more jobs. Jobs that normal people like you and I have. It does not matter how much the manufacturer/store makes in a year, it is still their money that they can use for raises, expansion, health care, ect. Could you imagine if we lived in a world where your wealth made it ok for people to steal from? A world  where I could come to your house and steal your car because you have too much money anyways, and dont need that much money.\n\nIMHO the whole freedom of speech argument is a total cop out. To me that is a totally non issues. It reminds me of when slave states in the US turned slavery into a \"states rights\" issues when it is clearly a racism and money issues. Also, if I was to make a website on how to steal senior citizens social security but label it as \"educational only\" I would 100% see the merits of it getting pulled down. Technically it is \"free speech\" but it is speech aimed solely at stealing someone's hard work.\n\nThere is also the argument that because thepiartebay does not host any files and only directs, they are in the clear. However, there have been countless times that someone has been convicted of a crime for being an acquaintance, and some states even have bystander laws to punish people for not stopping a crime. If I was to drive my buddy to a bar house where he kills a man, than I will be indicted on aiding a murder. Sure I may have the right to drive where I want to  but that argument will never hold up in court. Even though I only directed to murderer to the scene and will be held partially responsible \n\nLove to hear your thoughts!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Many commenters took advantage of this story to identify Soros as a liberal equivalent of the Koch Brothers, a view I am not convinced of.\n\nI tried to distinguish Soros from the Koch brothers by pointing out that while both parties take advantage of current laws, the Kochs can be distinguished by their doggedness in perpetuating those very laws. [My comment wasn't well received](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/34pnjw/billionaire_george_soros_may_finally_get_that/cqx0ij6). Many of the responses that I and other Koch-detractors received accused us of being too selective about the billionaires that we criticized; that the Koch brothers were a distraction (\"boogeymen\")  from a larger problem of rising oligarchy in the United States.\n\nUpon reflection, I realized that I don't know a lot about the Koch Brothers, apart from what I have heard on reddit and NPR, primarily, over the past few years. Here are some things I think I know:\n\n* The Kochs promote climate change denial, which is useful when one is in the petroleum business\n* They astroturfed the Tea Party, which is nominally about freedom from the government and personal liberty (oversimplification?), but conveniently supports a very corporation/billionaire/petroleum industry friendly agenda\n* They have a poor environmental track record and support policies that will allow them to continue to harm the environment\n* They seek to maintain the low tax rate they enjoy personally, despite massive wealth inequality\n* They support low corporate tax rates, through the Tea Party and lobbying\n\nI'm concerned that my opinion is based on years of accumulated sentiments and not much dedicated critical thought. If I'm wrong about the Koch brothers, and as open-minded as I like to think I am, it shouldn't be too tough for you to change my view. Do the Kochs deserve the attention they get as the worst of the wealthy, or are they scapegoats for a self-serving billionaire class?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Nearly every day I hear in a conversation, see on an advertisement, or read on the internet something along the lines of: Having sex with a drunk woman regardless of consent is rape. Although I do agree that it is very low for a man to have sex with a drunk woman just because she is drunk and somehow \"easy\" I do NOT agree that if a woman is drunk, has sex, and regrets it later on, that the sex should be considered rape.\n\nThe only instance where sex or any sexual acts should be considered as rape is in a situation where the man/woman **explicitly** says a form of \"no\". whether that is verbal, body language, or otherwise. EDIT: I should note that if a man/woman is passed out, too drunk to speak, or something in a similar pool, I would strongly consider all of those circumstances in which the person cannot express a yes or no to be rape.\n\nI happen to have a close male friend who while he and a woman were drunk, had sex with said woman. This woman grew to dislike my friend and explained to the police that it was rape since she did not know what was happening. Luckily after things got more legal she  backed down and dropped any potential charges. This is only one of so many hundreds of stories similar to this.\n\nIn conclusion:\n* consent is just the same drunk as it is sober.\n* regretted sex (of any kind) is not rape\n* It is not a man's job to not have sex with drunk women, rather it is everyone's job to understand consent and to understand that drinking can lead to regrettable/bad decisions.\n\n_____\n\nI want to say again that I am not in favour of sober people having sex with drunk people.

I can think of two really clear instances where sex is bad and should be discouraged, even though all parties give consent:\n\n*  **Cheating**  If Adam and Beth decide to have sex with eachother, and they're both in committed monogamous marriages with other people, then they can consent as much as they want.  They're still doing something wrong by breaking their commitments to their spouses and likely causing a great deal of harm to them in the process.  And it would be completely fine to judge Adam and Beth for deciding to sleep with eachother.\n\n*  **Adult-child relationships.**  I know what people are going to say, \"children can't consent.\"  But what you mean is children cannot *legally* consent, because this act is illegal.  This is just a legal technicality, but a 15 year-old could still consent (in the sense that they make a conscious, informed decision to have sex with someone and express that decision) to having sex with a 40 year-old man.  However, despite that consent, it's still the kind of thing that we as a society should discourage, despite the fact that both parties involved may consent.\n\nCMV.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I've spent enough time around primates--specifically bonobo apes--to believe that, while they might not have all the capabilities of a human, they are \"nearly human,\" i.e. they have brains that are ballpark like ours, and I can't say for sure their lives lack the kind of meaning I find in my own--the meaning that makes life worth preserving. If we agree that it's unethical to experiment on incapacitated humans (mentally handicapped, comatose, etc.), then we shouldn't be allowed to experiment on primates.\n\nI'm not a vegetarian, nor am I an animal-rights activist. I'm agnostic about the degree to which many animals can think, feel, imagine, and suffer, but the capacity for primates to do all of the above is--to me, obviously--uncomfortably close to our own, and, as such, they deserve the same sort of autonomy we consider to be among the \"inalienable rights of man\". Here is a mild, but more informed, [take](http://animalresearch.thehastingscenter.org/report/the-case-for-phasing-out-experiments-on-primates/) on this issue. (You can also google \"non-human personhood\" for more.) It's not without repercussions for many areas of medicine such as HIV research, but I think that infecting an ape with HIV is not much different from infecting a person who cannot speak or think at an adult level. It's a case of protecting \"the least of us,\" even as it makes important work like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/36hq9i/potential_new_vaccine_blocks_every_strain_of_hiv/) more difficult.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But I will make my case regardless:\n\n* Cutting the sandwich into halves, be it triangles or rectangles, **enables you to start your sandwich consumption in the dead center of the sandwich**, where fillings are most concentrated. This coats the inside of your mouth with said fillings, which supplements each additional bite. \n\n\n* You made a ham and cheese sandwich because you wanted ham and cheese, not bread with a little ham and cheese. Therefore, **the entire *existence* of this sandwich is dependent on the taste of those fillings**. By starting a whole sandwich from the dry, less-satisfying outside, you are immediately ruining the sandwich experience by taking that first bite of majority bread taste. If you wanted a bread sandwich, you could've just put toast between two pieces of toast.\n\n\n* **It is easier to hold a sandwich half**. A sandwich half is more portable, and easy to maneuver, than trying to hold together a heavily-laden sandwich that sags in the middle and threatens to disembark from your hands.\n\n\n* **The first bite of the triangle half corner is optimized for your mouth.** By turning the sandwich into a more aerodynamic shape, even phallic if you must, the triangle corner allows for less effort involved to place the corner in your mouth. \n\n\n* **A sandwich cut in half is more visually appealing** because you can see all the layers of filling that [you so painstakingly constructed](http://rampantcuisine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/REUBEN-CUT-IN-HALF-SIDE-VIEW-SMALL.jpg). Conversely, a whole sandwich appears as two layers of bread, especially if you're only using a few ingredients.

{"title": "CMV: Open carry of guns in the United States is foolish and it causes more trouble than good.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_36ibec", "selftext": "Edit to Clarify: In the below post I am talking about civilians who open carry to protest their right to carry weapons.  They aren't walking around in self defense, they go out into public prepared to have a confrontation with police, to make a video to post online.\n\nThere have been a lot of videos recently of civilians walking around in public with rifles/assault style weapons in an attempt to cause an interaction with police where they video the police response as a means to demonstrate that they have the right to carry weapons openly in public.  I believe that this causes more trouble and does not serve to advance a positive agenda due to the following points:\n  \n* **Makes people fear for their safety.**  The United States has a long history of incidents where someone commits or attempts to shoot and kill lots of people in a public place.  There are multiple incidents of mass shootings a year, some more deadly than others.    If you see someone walking down the road with a rifle strapped to their back it is disconcerting, and makes you wonder if you are about to be murdered in a shooting.\n\n* **Diverts police from doing their primary jobs**  If police are tasked with the job of protecting and serving the public, there time is wasted by having to engage an armed person walking down the street with a gun.  They have to investigate if the person is wanted, has a right to have the gun, and generally babysit the person so that the public feels safe.  If the police come, and have an interaction with the person, judge them to be safe and leave, then it only takes a few minutes without a police officer there for another concerned citizen to call 911 to report an armed person.  The police in effect become babysitters for a one person protest instead of conducting traffic patrols, responding to crimes, etc.\n\n* **Makes gun owners look bad** Owning something that has the ability to severely injure or kill another requires a certain level of responsibility.  By making the general public feel unsafe, a person demonstrating open carry is demonstrating an understanding that their actions are making people uncomfortable yet doing it anyway because their views are more important that the comfort and feelings of safety held by the surrounding community.  This violation of an unspoken social code seems selfish: as in \"getting my view out there is more important than your feelings of security\".  This reflects poorly on gun owners who own guns but don't engage in open carry activities.  \n\n* **It's a vague way to protest** There are no signs being carried by these gun owners about their rights and what they believe in.  Their presence is a question mark.  When you see an open carry protest, it's not immediately apparent what is going on and if someone was neutral or unaware of the issue of rights associated with gun ownership wouldn't be persuaded.  The first questions that run through a person mind when they witness this form of protest is \"Am I in danger?\" not \"I wonder what this person is protesting and why it's important\".\n\nChange my mind.\n\nEdit: formatting."}
{"title": "CMV: Basic Income Is Infeasible And Will Destroy The Economy", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_36hioe", "selftext": "There is a popular opinion on Reddit that \"basic income\" is a good idea. \"Basic income\" is the idea that every citizen is given enough money to cover basic needs like food, rent, etc. If they wish to earn more, they have to work for it.\n\nSome arguments I'm already aware of:\n\n&gt;Crime rates will likely decline due to reduced poverty level.\n\nLikely true for poverty-driven crimes like theft, but likely has little impact on other more serious crimes in which money isn't the motivating factor(or big hauling crimes like ponzi schemes/ransomware)\n\nIf you set it too low, crimes will happen anyways because criminals want more luxuries/can't cover basic costs. If you set it too high, nobody will work and it'll be too expensive to support.\n\n&gt;It is cheaper to pay basic income than the costs of law enforcement and running prisons\n\nAlso likely untrue. You have to consider that EVERYONE would be getting \"basic income\", and that is a lot more expensive than just keeping the criminals in jail. Also, not every criminal will obey laws just because they receive basic income. The reduced amount of criminals is unlikely to cover the costs of paying income to every single citizen.\n\nNow, for arguments against it:\n\n-**If basic income existed, many 100% capable people would refuse to work, or work less**\n\nIf I could live reasonably comfortable, why work? I could slave away for 40 hours a week just to earn money that gets taxed to hell to support basic income, or I can just relax and live comfortably. Time is valuable, I don't mind giving up luxuries to save time doing what I love-browsing reddit and playing videogames.\n\nI don't mind if I wouldn't be able to afford fancy stuff like a nice car or a high end gaming PC, I'd still be much happier with more free time and cheap belongings than having to work my life away to enjoy a few nice things.\n\nIf a large portion of my hard earned money went to people that refuse to work, i don't see any reason to. I'd rather just join them and leech off of the middle/upper class that works risky jobs or \nskilled positions that bring us high end products and services.\n\nMaybe I would work a few hours a week just to save for nice things, but it would depend on how much I'm getting for free.\n\n**Wage spiral inflation, alongside unemployment, will result in high prices and reduced supply**\n\nLess people working will result in reduced supply. Additionally, unemployed people would still have money, so the increased demand will result in a shortage of goods.  \n\nThe \"1%\"(really the 0.001% people refer to) don't necessarily spend all their money-they just hoard it. As a result, prices are not pushed up by their abundance of wealth because it sits in limbo being thrown into speculative markets and assets. Only time it screwed over the middle/lower class was when the real estate bubble turned housing into a speculative tool and inflated prices to hell before crashing it.\n\nThings that lower class individuals need(food, utilities, etc) aren't hoarded by rich individuals. A billionaire doesn't eat 1,000,000 pounds of potatoes a day, so it doesn't influence the pricing on that. Same with utilities like gas, electricity, water, etc. The ONLY hoarding problem I see with billionaires is the real estate market, where housing is used as an investment tool.\n\nNow, they might go crazy with stuff like a private jet/pilot, solid gold statue, expensive jewelry, and other luxuries, but those don't impact the pricing of everyday items as much as you would think. \n\nbasically, the huge abundance of wealth the .1% isn't as significant because it's simply hoarded, unlike low-middle class individuals that will spend the majority of what they make.**Having 50% of the country's wealth does not equate to consuming 50% of the country's production**\n\nAs a result, basic income would need to be continually raised to support rising prices, which would raise the prices more, resulting in a nonstop cycle of inflation. \n\nFrom this, we can conclude that basic income will:\n\n-Reduce productivity, as many people stop working or work less(Less output of goods/services)\n\n-Increase prices due to reduced supply\n\n-Result in a shortage of goods.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI'm not against welfare that helps those unable to work or that helps people that were laid off and looking for new employment. I just worry about basic income because it takes money from hard working individuals, and gives it to 100% capable individuals that refuse to work, resulting in people quitting their jobs and punishing people that contribute to society.\n\n**The ONLY way I see basic income working is if autonomous technologies advance enough to where people don't need to work anymore, and robots do everything besides creative/artistic works.**\n\n\n\n"}
{"title": "CMV: Islam is incompatible with today's society.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_36h7tj", "selftext": "Islam is a religion that spawned from the Quran, a religious text considered to be the Word of God (Allah). This religion began in the Arabian peninsula in the early 600s. \n\nIslam is not only out of date, dangerous to today's society and subversive, but it has always been a violent religion. This would be fine if Islam could be reformed. But that's the trouble with Islam. It has not been widely reformed and I'm afraid it cannot be due to its structure. Sure, it has a similar structure\n\nThe concept of Dar-al-harb/Garb/Kufr (War, War(ottoman),Infidel) and the Dar-al-Islam (Islam/Peace) is one that divides the world into two; nations that follow the law of Islam (Shariah) and those that don't. Before you say that this practice is outdated and out of style, please look at Salafis, the extremist groups in the middle east, and [this fine fellow and other people like him that do not classify as salafis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV710c1dgpU). Even if the Quran is not taken literally, Shariah law still applies. I have lived in an Islamic country. You do not need to take the Hadith and Quran literally to be subject to literal Shariah law.\n\nRead here:\n&gt;Looking at the Malaysian legal system as a whole, sharia law plays a relatively small role in defining the laws on the country. It only applies to Muslims. With regards to civil law, the Syariah courts has jurisdiction in personal law matters, for example marriage, inheritance, and apostasy. In some states there are sharia criminal laws, for example there is the Kelantan Syariah Criminal Code Enactment 1993. Their jurisdiction is however limited to imposing fines for an amount not more than RM 5000, and imprisonment to not more than 3 years. In August 2007, the then Chief Justice of Malaysia proposed to replace the current common law application in Malaysia with sharia law\n\nYou can literally go to jail for renouncing Islam. It's far more serious in countries like Saudi Arabia, and 4 in 10 muslims in the UK want to establish Shariah law. In fact, there are 85 shariah law courthouses in the UK which run by court-approval basis. I personally believe that the political stress plus the fact that both parties signed an agreement to be judged by shariah law makes every case a stamp-and-go case. Before you say that both if both parties consent to it, it's alright, please think about the cultural and familial pressure of Islam and their treatment of women.\n\nWe must not forget Islam's borderline slavery of women. They are covered, silenced, veiled, separated, and treated as commodity. God willing, they at least inherit half the amount a man of the same level of descendence would.\n\nI do not say that muslims are bad people and must convert to be part of today's society. I do not say that at all. In fact, I say the opposite. If anything can stop the self-indulgent hedonism of today's society it is Muslims (And Sikhs). I just say that Islam conflicts with today's society, and it cannot be wholly compatible with today's world. I do not approve of Islam. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Amtrak should receive much higher levels of funding than they do now.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_36fy31", "selftext": "Unfortunately, the only time Amtrak specifically and passenger rail generally become a part of public discussion seems to be when something goes wrong. Most of you are probably aware that something did go wrong last week, when Amtrak's Northeast Regional #188 derailed in Pennsylvania. This CMV is not about that incident, however.\n\nI have long held the view that the passenger rail should, and inevitably will, become a much larger part of our national transportation mix. I've yet to hear a thoughtful, legitimate argument against greater investment in passenger rail, specifically Amtrak. Most people who oppose Amtrak, particularly in Congress, seem to be doing so based on ideological or political reasons. For example, the last Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has called Amtrak a \"Soviet style railroad\". Most criticisms of Amtrak I've heard are similarly based in ideological beliefs. \n\nNow, I will try to briefly summarize some of the key reasons I've long thought Amtrak should be a top priority for investment and expanded funding.\n\n* Critics of Amtrak often point to the fact that it is a money losing operation, and is consequently subsidized by taxpayer money. This is perhaps the most common complaint from some (not all) Republicans. The way I see it, all modes of transportation are heavily subsidized, and Amtrak should not be singled out for losing money. All railroads, public and private, are responsible for all of their infrastructure. That means every inch of rail, every freight terminal and passenger station, every locomotive and car, their traffic management systems, and even their own police departments. By contrast, we (the taxpayer) fund the construction and maintenance of airports and highways. We pay for the FAA, which manages private airline traffic. We pay for the TSA, which provides security for the airlines. We pay for traffic officers in police departments. The bankrupt Highway Trust Fund, paid for by the federal gas tax, no longer covers all of its costs. Consequently, Congress has bailed it out with short term extensions for more than eight years now. According to Amtrak's CEO, Joe Boardman, these \"bailouts\" have added up to more than Amtrak's entire operating subsidy since its inception in 1975. So, with all this in mind, it seems ridiculous to single out passenger rail as the only transportation mode that needs to be profitable and should not be subsidized. We subsidize all modes, and all lose money, why should Amtrak be the one exception?\n\n* Even if Amtrak was as burdensome on taxpayers as some politicians and pundits suggest, there seems to be a strong public interest in expanding passenger rail. Unlike road and air competition, even if you personally do not use Amtrak, you benefit from higher Amtrak ridership. According to the Brookings Institute, Amtrak is now the fastest growing method of transportation. Its broken its ridership records nearly every year for the past 12 years, with the Northeast Corridor (NEC) in particular booming since the introduction of the Acela. Amtrak controls more than 75% of all air-rail traffic in the Northeast, which benefits air and road travelers as well. Less traffic on our already congested highways, less traffic in our airports, less pollution in our air, and downward pressure on the demand for oil are all secondary effects that benefit people who do not use Amtrak.\n\n* If lowering our dependence on foreign oil via decreased demand and if global warming is a concern for you as it is for me, then prioritizing rail over air and road transportation seems to be a necessity. Trains are masters of efficiency in a way that even the most fuel efficient jet and greenest hybrid are not. According to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in 2012 Amtrak's energy intensity per passenger mile sat at 1,561 British thermal units. By contrast, the average domestic airline service uses 2,477 BTUs per passenger mile. For some reason, 2006 is the last available data on passenger cars, and they used 2,898 BTUs and light trucks used 5,465 BTUs per passenger mile. Even private freight carriers are extremely efficient. According to FreightRailWorks.com, the average train can move one ton of freight 475 miles on one gallon of fuel. These facts suggest to me that the future lies in rail, not road, and that further Amtrak expansion could help lower our national energy consumption and transportation related pollution.\n\nSo Change My View! Like I said, most arguments against Amtrak seem overly politicized. So I'm interested to hear any cogent argument opposing passenger rail investment generally or Amtrak specifically. I suppose the latter is likely easier to make than the former, because it could be possible to support passenger rail investment but oppose Amtrak as an entity.

This is a fundamental change in the mechanic of the food, and it alone would warrant the hot dog's exclusion from the \"sandwich\" family. \n\nThe differences aren't limited to the physical configuration, though. There is also strong social argument that the hot dog is not a sandwich. If you were invited over to a friend's for sandwiches, you would probably be surprised to find that they only had a selection of hotdogs and sausages, along with buns and condiments. A word can be said to mean what people think it means, and most people do not think \"sandwich\" means \"hot dog\".\n\nIf you are more of a prescriptive linguist (and so many on reddit are), Oxford Dictionary defines a sandwich as \n\n&gt;an item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal\n\nHot dogs do not fit this description, because the bun is only one piece of bread. The bun is more of a carrying sheath for the hot dog tube, rather than the hot dog being a filling for the bun.\n\nI simply cannot buy that a hot dog is correctly classified as a sandwich.

If it is legal to turn right on red after checking for incoming traffic from your left in one lane, why would it not be in another?  I don't think there is a significant likelihood of cars from more than one turn lane crashing into each other.\n\nI also don't think it likely that a vehicle turning right on red from the leftmost right turn lane would be more likely to collide with oncoming traffic.  Surely he would check both lanes of traffic before turning, just as the inside lane would check the rightmost incoming traffic lane as well as whether there is anyone that might be changing lanes into his lane before the intersection.\n\nHowever, I imagine that someone somewhere had a reason for making this a law, so I am quite willing to change my view if given reasoning as to why turning right on red from anything but the inside lane is predominantly illegal.\n\nEdit: going to bed.

And I started thinking about if things were ever like that for older generations. And I realized, they probably were.\n\nThink about the industrial revolution. You're a copyist. Every day, you go to work and your job is to read a document and rewrite it. Maybe you have a different document every day, maybe you need to just push out a certain quantity before you move on to the next project. But then suddenly the printing press is invented and you're *terrified*. \n\nI feel like this is just another industrial revolution. Despite the quickly developing technology *and* expanding populations, there doesn't seem to be an overwhelming poverty creeping up on us. \n\nI believe that *education* is the problem. That copyist was probably a specialist of some kind. Not everyone really knew how to read at all, so there was an education barrier to that career that allowed some people to do it and others were out of luck. And most fields are somewhat like that. \n\nNowadays it's hard to find someone in the US who never learned how to read. It's almost hard to wrap your mind around it. Most people even graduate high school, which while isn't required was once a barrier people had to get through. Now it seems as though you can hardly get above a minimum wage job without a college degree. \n\nI think that the purpose of education, any education at all, is to give someone the tools they need to succeed. Which is pretty hard to argue against. I say that education in the US is failing pretty miserably and that's the reason we've got something to fear. \n\nEducation, in politics, is a word you use when you want people to give you votes and money. Saying you're *for education* is like saying you're *against murder*. It's a crowdpleaser. But if you actually look at what's being done for education, it's a total hatchet job. \n\nThat's what we should be scared about. That the education barrier is being raised to a point where the average person can't find a steady and reasonably paying job. Once, all you needed to do was know how to read. Now you basically need a master's degree in your field, which you only have if you've been funded (parents, money, etc.) or you've been so sure about what you wanted to do with your life that you've worked your ass off for that field since you were 15. \n\nSure, there will always be work that the average US citizen is overqualified for. You know, the kind with a bachelors degree, debt, and no real career options. But companies are allowed to ship that work to other countries which have work environments full of parasites and suicides. So unless that changes, the average citizen should be entitled to a reasonable life. Which means billions invested into k-12 education and college tuition regulation or elimination."}

{"title": "CMV: Poor Americans shouldn't be buying houses and be renting instead.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_36chns", "selftext": "I believe that poor americans shouldn't be taking out large mortgages that they don't have the ability to pay for. Instead they should rent out apartments.Homeownership is toted as beneficial to individuals but that has not been the case in the wake of the housing bubble. From where I stand, I feel home owners buy bigger houses than they would normally buy if they had to save up for the money instead of taking out loans. This is partly because when people buy homes, they feel that it is something permanent hence, they should get a good one. Also, tax deductions and low interest rates distort market signals, influencing people to buy larger houses than they would've otherwise. \n\nYou might say that housing is an investment and one of the few ways for the poor to invest their savings. I would disagree. Most people want to buy their houses for life and are unlikely to sell their houses (more than once or twice in a lifetime at max). You would have better luck at the stock market. Which unlike the housing market is easier to liquidate and  buy/sell. \n\nAlso, renting in my opinion is cheaper. Why? Because people are more likely to rent smaller apartments than what they would've gone for if they were buying the place. That again, is the psychological effect of seeing housing a long term investment and also the emotional aspect of thinking a home is special and since I'm buying it once, I should get a good one. Moreover, the existence of a bubble proves that the price of homes had exceeded its value (which is rent) and continues to do so due to all the speculation going around in the housing market. \nLets not forget, that renting also allows you the option to change homes readily when a cheaper one is available. If you owned a house you probably wouldn't be selling it for a mere hundred dollars a month, even though over time that might be a large sum but selling a house is a rough ordeal and finding buyers who are willing to pay the asking price is hard. Overall, it isn't easy changing homes you own as it is when you are renting. \n\nOne more point for renting, it allows you to be mobile and move to places where jobs are least abundant to where it is most. You can change neighborhoods easily when the one you are living in is going to dumps. Owning a home would make it difficult as the value of your homes drop and you are unable to move without incurring a huge loss.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There was a murder of an unborn child in one episode. \n\nYet the only reaction people have to those is that \"they miss that character\" or \"OMG I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.\"\n\n**HERE'S WHAT I'M NOT SAYING:** I'm not saying that rape is acceptable, or that we should just sit back and enjoy it when it's depicted on film. That scene was hard as hell to watch. I'm also not saying that we should be outraged that Game of Thrones (or any show for that matter) is ultra violent and depicts so much murder. \n\nBut I think it's absurd to get worked up about a show depicting something terrible (rape) while totally ignoring that it constantly depicts something that is, in my opinion, worse (murder). \n\nChange my view.\n\nEDIT: I guess I need to clarify a bit, as lots of people have posted regarding what it means to be \"offended\"/\"outraged.\" I have no problem with people being personally offended by something, either because it invokes a memory, or they simple find it difficult to sit through. To clarify my position, being offended by something, and then taking to the internet to say that the show's creators were WRONG to show it, is ridiculous. \n\nExample of what I'm talking about (scroll down for Twitter reactions as well):\n[here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/game-of-thrones/11612290/rape-game-of-thrones.html)\n\n**EDIT 2: Really wish I had worded things better, but it's fine, I think it still made for a good discussion. I'm gonna stop responding to most things now, because I think enough people share my view that I'm not necessarily needed. Also, I do apologize if this ruffled any feathers or brought up any rough memories for anyone--it's always challenging to discuss rape in a careful yet constructive way, so I hope it went that way for the most part.

This country seemed special to me. It seemed like one of the safest places to live, and before *really* living in it, I wanted to give back some of the years of my life in order to keep it safe for the next kid to grow up in.  I am not democratic or republican, I just believe that our safety is #1, and I would rather be over-kill than under when it comes to it.\n\nI think one of the reasons the US is so well protected, so much so that we will never have another war on our homeland, so much so that we could deter almost all biological, chemical, ballistic, nuclear what-have-you threats against us, so much so that if there were to be an all-out free for all war across the entire globe, we would be the last ones standing, is because of our over powering military.  We are unparalleled in any nation in technology, even the stuff the gov't allows us to see is spectacular, and we are the ones selling new tech to our allies, not the other way around. I believe it is this \"untouchableness\" that keeps us safe, no country on the planet would feel good going into a fight with us, and it's due to the national defense budget.\n\nAs a democratic nation, we have elected the people we found best suited for the job to run our country, so why would we not empower them to make bills supporting the military? It is these peoples *jobs* to figure out what we need to remain the top global superpower, we elected these people, and yet we have citizens who would prefer more spending in infrastructure so they can get to work faster.\n\nI am on track to become a naval pilot with hopes to obtain a masters degree and move on to work for NASA after my 5 year commitment, so I will be the first to understand that there are programs out there that could do crazy amazing things with even 5% of the military budget, but I still remain that I would put space exploration on the back burner to national safety.\n\nYes, perhaps we are going a little overkill on military spending, but it is in fact that overkill that keeps us untouchable in the global theater, and I would prefer to keep it that way than attempt to start divvying the military budget to everybody and their mother that seems to *need* that money until not much is left. \n\nAdditional pro-military-budget notes not related to US defense:\nWe are often called out for policing the world, but when there is bloodshed and conflict somewhere on the globe that needs to be cooled off, who do they call first?  Not to mention with our vast naval fleet, we are nearly always the first to respond and provide medicine and relief efforts to earthquakes, tsunamis, you name it.  Our military works to our allies' advantage as well, if a 9/11 incident were to occur in Britain you can be sure their Osama Bin Laden would be hunted down if not killed by our soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I no longer believe there is available to me (presently, vat-grown stuff is looking pretty neat) such a thing as 'humane' eggs or dairy-- among other examples, egg-laying hen breeders kill roosters when they are still chicks and dairy cows are forcibly impregnated and their babies taken away from them. I understand that there's no way to completely avoid harming another creature, especially in our current industrial agriculture system, but I think it's my responsibility to reduce the harm I do as much as I can. I live in the U.S., have a good income, real &amp; consistent access to vegan alternatives, and have never experienced health problems from not eating animal products.\n\nYet, I'm still struggling. Even after I added a 'freegan' clause that I can eat animal products I am not paying for that would otherwise be thrown away (just as I can buy used leather shoes-- I'm not contributing to demand for the product), I often give in to temptation when, say, ice cream is on the table. I know veganism is not about being perfect, but still, I know better. And there's a lot of social pressure-- everyone seems to hate vegans, thinks we're self-righteous pains in the ass, up to and including my live-in boyfriend. \n\nI truly believe that contributing to the demand for exploitative animal products is wrong, deeply wrong and utterly fucked. And at the same time, I desperately (forgive the adverbs) want to give up veganism altogether and eat a plate of cheese fries from my favorite dive bar every other day. Change my view?\n\n**Edit for clarity: I'm definitely rethinking some closely-held beliefs about whether you can produce eggs and milk without being cruel (thanks, Thoguth). That said, what I really, reallllly want to be convinced of is that it's cool to eat those cheese fries, for example.**\n\n**Edit 2: Okay, it's been four hours and some of these replies are verging on 'rude or hostile' territory, and most having nothing to do with egg or dairy production anymore, much less industrially. I'm calling it a night, but thanks to everyone who was polite and kind and to those who gave me food for thought.

{"title": "CMV: Fast food restaurant meals' default state should include no toppings", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_36b5nn", "selftext": "Hello, CMV! I'll clarify myself with a situation that just happened to me. I went to a fast food restaurant, ordered my meal, and took it home to eat. When I opened up my food, I realized the meal included a large amount of chopped onions. Now, I absolutely loathe the taste of onions so my choices were to slowly pick out each onion, then add some other topping to mask the taste or not eat the food I just bought. This led me to realize that the default for food at fast food places should have no toppings at all and, if you want toppings, you would just ask to have the workers add them on.\n\nFrom a customer's perspective, I think this would cause a lot of people less issues when ordering food. There are plenty of people, for example, who don't like the default lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mustard, mayo etc. that are put on hamburgers. However, not every hamburger meal includes those toppings. So, customers have to either know or ask what comes on the meal in order to ensure no topping they don't like is included. With the new system, they would just order what meal they wanted and ask the workers to add what reasonable toppings they want which I think is much easier and way less likely to lead to mistakes and unhappy customers.\n\nNow, this would only include toppings that aren't stated outright in the meal name. For example, if you order a BBQ bacon burger, of course the hamburger is going to include BBQ sauce and bacon. Or if you order a grilled onion hot dog, of course the hot dog is going to have grilled onions. My proposal is just for meals without specific toppings in the name like a McDouble or a Whopper.\n\nFrom a restaurant's perspective I think it would save a fair amount of money because you're not preparing to add on 3-5 toppings on a meal that could just end up in the trash. Instead, you're just liable for the basics and any extras would be added on. I don't see a reason for the price of meals to change at all. Whether customers have toppings on their meals or not in the current system, the price usually stays the same.\n\nSo there it is, change my view!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Anyone who believes that inflicting physical pain or death on an adult as punishment for a perceived wrongdoing believes in revenge, not justice.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_36ax2q", "selftext": "Whilst browsing Reddit, I come across comments with surprising popularity that endorse the idea that people who have committed a crime are fully deserving of a physical punishment, often carried out by someone acting on the interests of the victim, regardless of what the law has to say on the matter. Posts talking about fathers beating up boys who cheat on their daughter, or killing a man who drove drunk and killed their son in the process, often receive support following the idea that \u2018they totally deserved it, they were awful people\u2019.\n\nI feel that this is a barbaric way of looking at things. Many people seem to be of the opinion that \u2018an eye for an eye\u2019 is the best form of justice, that it settles all disputes. This person killed someone, so we should kill them. That person cheated, they should get beaten up. Fair is fair right? \n\nBut that\u2019s just revenge, defined as \u2018the action of hurting or harming someone in return for an injury or wrong suffered at their hands\u2019. Does a person who cheated, whilst it is an undeniably awful breach of trust, deserve to receive physical punishment for their actions? The aggrieved might think so, but I find it incredible that even people who are not directly involved are not reasonable enough to admit that this shouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nIn more serious cases, such as murder, I still do not believe that the perpetrator\u2019s death can bring about anything other than brief respite for the aggrieved. I understand that people feel that killing a murderer improves society by their absence, but I believe that whilst idealistic, the method of attempted rehabilitation is preferable (and actually is cheaper, if that should be a factor at all) than killing the person. I don\u2019t think a person forfeits their human rights by breaching those of another, as doing so would make those in charge of their fate act as the accused has acted. \n\nThe punishment for a crime should not be decided by the victim or those with the victim\u2019s interests at heart, and such actions should not be celebrated. Instead, a group of unbiased individuals who can make their decision based on justice should decide, not revenge.\n\n**TL;DR** Explain to me why the punishment someone receives for their actions should be based on revenge for the victim and not an unbiased judgement based on justice.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Given the possibility that God actually does exist and assuming an infinite gain or loss associated with belief or unbelief in said God (as represented by an eternity in heaven or hell), a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.). Pascal formulated the wager within a Christian framework. \n\nI am addressing the counter-arguments of \"Nature as not a proof of the existence of God\" and \"Argument from inauthentic belief\", which you should read about if you would like to talk to me about those.\n\nSince I'm not great at reported speech, I will quote the thoughts of my imaginary atheist:\n\n&gt;I am an atheist. I believe there is no deity or higher power which governs nature.\n\n&gt;As such, I am most probably damned by a great number of religions.\n\n&gt;If I love my child, and if wish it well, I must do everything in my power to secure that.\n\n&gt;One of those things is instilling faith into my child. \n\n&gt;I should feign faith, as hard as I can, to make my child a believer, and a practicing one, at best.\n\n&gt;That way, their faith will be sincere and strong, even if mine is not, saving them, and MAYBE EVEN me in the process.\n\nI only see as conflicting the \"Argument from inconsistent revelations\",\n&gt;Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the wager, in an argument known as the argument from inconsistent revelations. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in \"the wrong god\", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager.\n\ne but even so, instilling ANY faith could still be better than NO faith, more because a number of deities value believers more than non-believers.\n\nAs such, Change My View, from the standpoint that there is multiple religions, and, for the sake of argument, from the standpoint that there is only one religion in the world (imagine a planet of only Christians and atheists, or Jews and atheists, etc.)\n\ntl;dr - I should teach my kid to believe in God and be a good human being, and not just the latter.\n\nEDIT: I understand rule B and that is why I have given two options.\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I fell really deep into senioritis (the condition where one has gotten into college but remains in highschool until graduation, and becomes exceedingly lazy) and managed to convince my parents that my bad grades (aka so bad I was close to NOT graduating) were a result of undiagnosed attention deficit. I've since been prescribed vyvanse. Now, the difference on this stuff is incredible. I am motivated, I am hardworking, and I am happy when I'm on it. I am a fully productive member of society when I'm on this stimulant. Furthermore, I've visited the adderall/vyavnse subreddits/forums and the consensus is mostly the same. Its a goddamned \"magic pill\". \n\n\n\nMainly, the users I read that dislike it are the ones who were put on the stuff at an exceedingly early age. Which I agree is a (for the most part) terrible thing. Especially if they never really had an attention deficit disorder.\n\nThe thing is, I don't see why we prevent people who don't have add from taking this (other than the potential for abuse). A lazy, unproductive person wants to turn himself around and become productive? I don't see why they shouldn't have the opportunity to take this. Someone needs to do some spring cleaning but can't get themselves to do it? Why *prevent* them from using this? \n\nOverall, I just see these stimulants as a tool. And furthermore, from a societal perspective, its use by people seems to be almost entirely beneficial.\n\nNow, there is the potential for abuse. I want to disregard this part for discussion, however. 2 reasons: 1) I only want to talk about the people without ADHD but who want to self-improve. 2) those who want to abuse can already do so in that its not extremely difficult to get it illegally.\n\nOne other point is that it provides an unfair advantage to students. Well, I see it as a choice. If you use it it is entirely up to the individual. The people who feel disadvantaged have an equal opportunity to get it (disregarding prices). There are already people without ADHD using the drugs, the only difference is that they pretend to have it. \n\nA final point that I think some people have is the \"zombification\" of students. I say that's bullshit though. Personally, I've never been happier with both my academics \"and* my social life. Never before have I had so much time to enjoy my free time because I'm no longer aimlessly procrastinating or taking forever to do simple assignments.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The kings in Denmark used to be elected, some thousand years ago, but then it became normal to elect kings from the same familly.

I've seen avocado percentages as low as 8%. That is false advertising. Guacamole is made from avocado. Not cream cheese. \n\nYou may say that they do show the ingredients list, so it should not care.

{"title": "CMV: Black slavery is alive and well in the United States.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_368kws", "selftext": "Hi, allright so as I see it.\nBlack Americans make up ~10% of our population but ~40% of our incarcerated.  \n\nLarge majorities of our incarcerated population have been sentenced on minor drug and possession charges made possible by the war on drugs.\n\nThe US prison system is structured as a profitable venture, those profits coming overwhelmingly from the tax-pool (insofar as I understand this).\n\nThe only conclusion I can reach from this is that an institution of normalized slavery exists and functions on a wide scale in the united states.  \n\nFollowing emancipation, there was a long period where black slavery in America truly did function, with large work camps and prison gulags sourcing labour from the black community after slapping them with minor charges, loitering, etc.  As far as I can tell, this never stopped and has only grown in scope.\n\n\nRacial minorities in america (overwhelmingly black and hispanic) are obviously mostly incarcerated.  Whether or not our justice system is structurally racist is not the issue here.  It is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USA_2009._Percent_of_adult_males_incarcerated_by_race_and_ethnicity.png\n\nI sort of came here from elsewhere on reddit after running into this documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAJLSpUXawE   \n(from where I cited the work camp/gulag comment)\n\nAnyway, this realization has made me quite uncomfortable,  that my tax dollars support.. you know, racial slavery,  because even after a brief review of the numbers involved here... yea I don't know what else to call it.   Is that not what is going on here?  Is there something I don't fully understand about how prisons operate?  "}
{"title": "CMV: MRAs are right to claim that there are men's issues. However, the way they're trying to address them is ineffective and quite possibly makes things worse.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_368ijm", "selftext": "The fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the ACTUAL PERPETRATOR. That's disgusting, and obviously I could list many other real problems.\n\nBut the MRM is not the best solution to these problems, and often gives men's issues such bad press that it's toxic to defend them. In other words, it's not the MRM's fault that these problems exist, but it's actively damaging to the cause, quite possibly more than it has helped.\n\nDistancing itself from feminism breaks the gender equality world into \"men's activists\" and \"women's activists.\" This causes us to ignore that gender inequality is bad for everyone. No one wins when a man is arrested for being assaulted by a woman. This is not a victory for women's rights. Everyone loses, because a criminal walks free while an innocent person sits in jail. Sure, there are extremists who will claim to hate all men and think this is fine, but there are also crazy atheists who claim to hate all religious people. This isn't \"no true Scotsman,\" this is pointing out that it's unreasonable to define a group by its crazies, because if we did, no group would be reasonable. \n\nPitting MRAs against feminists undermines the notion of actual gender equality and makes it a \"men vs. women\" debate, which we all lose. \n\nIt would seem, to me, that a better strategy to promote men's issues would be to do it within the feminist movement. The feminist movement has existed for a long time and (relative to the MRM) is reasonably positively regarded. People get behind feminist issues. MRAs often complain that no feminists care about men's issues, but a) this doesn't seem to be entirely true unless we're yelling about strawmen and extremists and b) this would be even less true if people stopped leaving feminism/gender egalitarianism for the MRM. It looks like people are ditching feminism for the MRM and then complaining that feminists don't care about men's issues, which is only true because anyone who did left. Why can't we all just work together? I get that there are people who identify with all of the above, but it seems like EVERYONE who considers themselves ANY of the above should care about all of the above. I really can't think of an intellectually honest reason to care only about men's issues or women's issues. They're both real. So why are we treating them as opposing forces? It's not like we have to ban abortions because we start listening to male victims of violence. This isn't a zero sum game, why is it being treated as one? Everyone seems to think it is, and it just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nSome things I anticipate people saying:\n\n\"What about gender egalitarians?\"\n\nI think rebranding feminism as gender egalitarianism would probably be the best solution, but that's going to take a hell of a lot of time. One thing that would help is if feminists started acting like gender egalitarians and actually cared about all gender issues, and MRAs joining up with them would only speed up the process. As for people who consider themselves \"feminists and gender egalitarians,\" I see no issue. \"Feminist, MRA, and gender egalitarian\" is fine too, although I've never encountered one who phrased it like that. Those who consider themselves anti-feminists but gender egalitarians... Eh. I really don't know, but I feel like shitting on feminism in general is not helpful to the gender equality discussion. (this is as opposed to legitimate critiquing, which is fair game. I'm not saying anything anyone labelled \"feminist\" does is above reproach, nor anything the movement does. I'm saying condemning all of modern feminism and trying to start from scratch is really unhelpful, especially when a huge part of the world is still incredibly patriarchal; see countries where getting raped is still a crime--if you're female). \n\n\"Feminists aren't open to men's issues. I hear what you're saying, but that's not possible.\"\n\nBecome a feminist open to men's issues. You're listening to one right now. Make that two and we're one step closer.\n\n\"It's right for men's and women's issues to have different advocates because they are different. You might as well be saying that feminism should just merge with the LGBTQ rights movement.\"\n\nI don't think that's true. Men's and women's issues differ, but they are rooted in the same fundamental ideas. The reason men are arrested when they are the victim of domestic violence by women is that we live in a society that sees women differently from men. It's benevolently sexist to say that a woman simply couldn't hurt a man except in self-defense. It's also hostile sexist against men to say that men are simply violent people. Men's and women's issues are intrinsically linked, because stereotypes and perceptions of gender roles are the root of both. Essentially, I think men's and women's issues are symptoms of the same problem, so they can be addressed together.\n\n\"Is your problem with anti-feminists, or MRAs? You seem to move between the two.\"\n\nBoth, to some degree. I don't think it's fair to treat those two entirely separately, given the links. MRAs who are anti-feminist are the ones I disagree with most. People who identify as MRAs but also feminists I'm largely okay with, but the MRM in general is not terribly kind to feminists and borders on actively anti-feminist, which is the problem I'm talking about here.\n\nEdit: Guys, I want to have a conversation! I really am open to chatting about this and changing my view. I know lots of CMV users love the MRM, it gets brought up all the time... I want to understand your perspective. I don't bite.\n\nEdit2: Well, I asked and you delivered! Definitely an interesting conversation here. Credit to u/Prince_of_Savoy for highlighting issues with feminism that make it inherently poorly compatible with the MRM. I'll be checking back and responding to comments that might get added later tonight, but I may not get to all of them--sorry about that! I am reading and listening to all that is said, and I appreciate the many varied takes on the issue that have come up.\n\nEdit3: Okay, there are still new, good comments being posted, but there's also a fair bit of needless vitriol. I'm not responding to any comment that was rude, so if you came here to post that, you won't be hearing from me. Namecalling doesn't change views and just makes you look like a dick."}

I support equal rights activism, but I don't support feminism, and here is my main reason (one of them).\n\nI feel that many modern American feminists don't understand the process of argument, and they tend to ignore the opposing opinion.\n\nHere is an example: I see so many feminists take a magazine cover like [this](http://ftape.com/media/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rihanna_GQ_Magazine_04.jpg) and one like [this](http://www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JGL-GQ.jpg) and say that the former is sexually objectifying women, while the second is praising men for being successful. \n\nI would post the link to the pro-feminist list that said this, but the link isn't working (TheAmazingAtheist made a video on the list, but the link he gave didn't work for me)\n\nThe reason I feel this argument holds little merit is for a few reasons:\n\n1) GQ is a men's magazine (the magazine in the images), so of course it will use sexually attractive women and succesful looking men to attract men to the magazine, that's called advertising. \n\n2) A magazine called \"Men's health magazine\" has covers that show sexually attractive men. Is that wrong? No, the point of the magazine is to attract men who want to be healthy, and having a man who is sexy on the cover will attract those men to be like \"I wanna be sexy too!\"\n\n3) This argument infers the opinion that human sexuality is \"bad\" and can not be shown off.\n\nThe above three statements can be reworded and applied to many feminist ideas. \n\nI am not saying that all Feminist arguments are illogical, but many of them are, because many American feminists aren't looking at the right issues.\n\nTL;DR: Many American-feminist's ideas have very little backing.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: There is nothing morally wrong with the death penalty", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_3679xh", "selftext": "In the wake of the Tsarnaev verdict, I\u2019ve been hearing a lot of voices decry the death penalty on a moral basis, with a lot of things like, \u201ckilling people is wrong, killing people for killing other people is wrong,\u201d or, \u201ckilling a killer only brings us down to their level\u201d being said. I\u2019d like to go against the reddit grain a little bit and explain why I believe 1) not all killing is equally wrong, and 2) why a person who kills another might deserve death. I will try to explain my position without appealing to religion or nebulous ideas of objective morality. \n\nIn general, humans fear death. Because we are intelligent, empathetic creatures, we can recognize that the same fear of death we have is shared by all other members of our species. We can therefore recognize that the killing of a human being by another is a more terrible act than, say, a bear killing a human being, since most animals cannot be said to be fully aware of all that they\u2019re taking from their victim when they kill them. The law recognizes intent to kill as a necessary precondition for a killing to qualify as murder. We also don\u2019t recognize the moral culpability of the criminally insane: a person has to be aware of the hurt they are causing--and still do it anyway--to turn an act of killing into a crime. The law (and common sense) recognizes that there are degrees of right and wrong\u2014if it didn\u2019t, there would be no legal distinctions between types of killing (e.g. 1st degree murder, 2nd degree murder, manslaughter, negligent homicide, etc.) nor would there be provisions for self defense, provocation, heat of passion, or special dispensation for soldiers in wartime. Determining the heinousness of an act of killing is not straightforward, and it is to ignore the complexities of real life to make such a blanket claim as \u201call killing is equally wrong.\u201d\n\nAnyway. Because humans fear death, we create laws that forbid killing and empower the state to enforce them; we do this, ostensibly, to protect ourselves. This is not a novel concept\u2014it\u2019s probably most famously articulated by Rousseau in *The Social Contract*. The \u201csocial contract\u201d is necessarily reciprocal in nature, however: all of us give up a little bit of freedom (the right to kill whomever we please) in exchange for the protection that such a law provides\u2014we agree not to kill other people, and other people agree not to kill us. When someone breaks the contract by killing an innocent person, they break both parts of the contract, and they are no longer protected under it. A person simply can\u2019t expect to benefit from the protection that such a law provides them their entire lives and then knowingly deprive someone else of theirs; this alone makes the act of killing a killer fundamentally different than killing an innocent person. People forget that the purpose of the death penalty is not revenge, it's punishment. Furthermore, once someone marks themselves as a threat to the community by committing an unjustified killing, the community, as exercised through the agents of the state and the justice system, is justified\u2014and I would argue, obligated\u2014to permanently eliminate that threat for the good of the whole community.\n\nI\u2019d like to end with a gigantic caveat\u2014I am strongly anti-death penalty, but not because I believe it to be morally wrong, nor financially unsound. Rather, I believe that the system that we use to determine guilt, like all systems made by man, is imperfect. Thus, because of the possibility, however small, of executing an innocent person, I believe that the death penalty should be abolished in all cases, assuming the alternative is life imprisonment without parole.\n\nCMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Most of the dialogue scenes between two characters follow a very uninteresting formula:\n\n\n* One character is doing something quietly by themselves (reading, eating, thinking, sweeping, etc.)\n* The other character approaches. We'll get a lot of static shots with both characters in the frame\n* The conversation plays out, and generally neither actor will really do much during the conversation. If they were doing something before (like making a fire) they'll keep doing it, but otherwise they'll either just sit there or stand there. Only in the most extreme of cases (usually during life-or-death bits) will they let emotion actually allow them to use gestures, or do things while speaking. They're reminiscent of Skyrim characters in that way. This wouldn't be such a problem if the camera wasn't so static and uninteresting also. We'll get lots of 'shot reverse-shot', lots of static shots with both characters in, and generally every shot will be there merely to be pointed at whoever is speaking and little more. There seems no attempt to use the beautiful language of cinema to convey emotion. That scene between Jon Snow and Brian Blessed in the most recent episode, for example, was not half as tense as it could have been in the hands of more competent cinematographers.\n\n\nI mean, put it this way. Watch this bit (1:20:39)[https://youtu.be/ABcXyZn9xjg?t=4839] of RedLetterMedia's excellent review of Star Wars: Episode 3. I feel you could almost lift RLM's criticism and apply it directly to Game of Thrones. Other than, as I've mentioned, the occasional decent shot (normally one per episode) and very occasionally a shot which is actually memorable (normally one per season) - can you really say Game of Thrones understands the power of shot composition any more than Episode 3 does?\n\n\nOne more point based on what I anticipate I will get in reply to this: I don't think it's unfair to hold TV shows to the same high standard of cinematography that films achieve. We've seen what TV shows can achieve with great filming: Breaking Bad (particularly the episodes directed by Rian Johnson such as 'Fly', 'Ozymandias' and '51') frames shots to help us understand its characters through the power of symbolism. Garth Marenghi's Darkplace exploits the limitations of the film medium for comedic effect. Even hit-and-miss shows like Sherlock manage to shoot scenes in creative, interesting ways. Game of Thrones, however, seems almost entirely utilitarian in its approach. As long as we can see what's going on in each shot, that's good enough for them.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Or even why his crimes are worthy of the death penalty. His actions are reprehensible, and I fully believe he is guilty and should receive punishment in accordance with law befitting his crimes.\n\nAnyways,\n\nThe bombing and subsequent manhunt resulted in 4 deaths and a dozens of injuries. Clearly a terrible tragedy, please do not misconstrue me, I think that what happened was awful.\n\nHowever, I think the response, especially around Boston has been extremely disproportionate.\nNews articles, to blogs, to overheard conversations, to David Ortiz, for the past 2 years all you hear is a sensationalized response that includes hate speech, violent calls for vengeance, overly emotional opining, and nonsense about \"Boston strong\" that arises from mob mentality I have seen countless comments on articles saying incredibly vengeful and disturbing things wished on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, \"I want to see him hang in the streets\" is a very mild example. Additionally I have seen a lot of anti-Muslim rhetoric and straight out bigotry because of these events.\nBostonStrong has become synonymous with the city and its prominent organizations. A charity for the victims (some of which include very profitable retail business in Copley Square) of the bombing has gathered millions in donations. I have seen people even tangentially related to Boston claiming it was an emotional and devastating event for them, again not victims, but someone who might have lived in Boston a few years back. What does Boston Strong even mean? I personally believe it means nothing. Boston reacted the way any city would to two rogue terrorists. It started as a way to raise money for the one fund but has devolved into nothing more than a marketing gimmick for area businesses and something for bros to use as a hashtag.\n\nHowever when you look at the outrage, vitriol, and media coverage surrounding other violent crimes, for example serial rape, multiple homicides, pedophilia, even drunk driving homicides. The level of interest and reaction is not even close.\n\nI understand it was a very public event with terrorist intentions, but people in Boston act like it's the next 9/11. It simply is not. No where near the damage and no connection to an international terrorist organization.\n\nIn many ways I think the actions of drunk drivers who kill a car full of innocents are as much or more reprehensible than those of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. A drunk driver kills someone due to their own selfishness and stupidity. Dzhokhar and his brother believed they were getting justice for innocent people killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. He knew very well that he would likely be caught, and yet he believed strongly enough that what he was doing was right that he went through with it then penned a letter in blood stating his motive as he lay dying in a boat.\n\nI'm not defending his actions I think they are terrible but I think the outrage and rah-rah mob mentality and blind patriotism (city-ism?) I've seen for the past two years is grossly misplaced. The Boston Strong mentality is flawed, the Tsarnaevs didn't attack Boston they attacked the US, Boston just happened to be where they lived, and while it was great to see a city come together after a tragedy I believe the Boston Strong thing was taken too far. Around college campuses it became a rallying cry to legitimize bigotry about immigrants from the middle east and an excuse to party, meanwhile atrocities committed by born and bred Americans go largely unnoticed.\n\nWhile no one I know personally was injured by the events, I am still from Boston but I failed to be personally hurt or particularly jarred by these events. Meanwhile, I witnessed students who had been in the city for a handful of months post impassioned social media posts calling for executions and making claims to how strong and resilient \"their city was\", no one was gonna mess with \"their\" town that they had been inhabiting for a whopping 1.5 college semesters.\n\nI think his crimes were terrible, but no more terrible than other similar crimes, and certainly not warranting the reaction that has occurred since Marathon Monday 2013. I just can't get behind the lynch mob, or the notion that somehow Boston reacted better than any other city would.\n\nTLDR- The hate, vitriol, and mob mentality surrounding the Dzhokhar Tsarnaev case is blown way out of proportion, considering atrocities that occur every day. this is particularly bad in Boston and even worse in Boston student communities.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We know there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt, which means anything that'd take out Earth would need to come from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud.  Both of these are very far away, and would give us lots of warning, even if the object were presently on its impact trajectory orbit.  More likely, we'd detect it multiple orbits in advance, and have decades or centuries before predicted impact.  But I think we'll at least have multiple years.\n\n2. Nuclear weapons would be pretty effective at deflecting an object.  They are very energy dense, and [we can use a standoff detonation](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html) to cause ablation on one side of the comet/asteroid and nudge it.  We only need a very slight nudge to push it off of an Earthbound trajectory when it is far away.\n\n3. If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it.  A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast.  We would allow launches which have a high chance of spreading radioactive debris onto Earth for instance, or which have a high chance of loss of human life.  We might even send astronauts on a suicide mission.  Of course, money would be no object for this, and massive logistical resources would be poured into anything with a chance of saving us.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: I don't see ANY reason why a system should exist where people automatically consent to organ donations and are forced to opt out.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_363i05", "selftext": "If you want to sacrifice your organs and give them to others that's great and very noble of you and you have my props for doing what you believe is right, but this is a different discussion:   \na) One of the most common arguments I see used is saying \"most people don't care either way\" and honestly, using statistics to say \"omg People don't care\" is silly. It's ridiculously to spin statistics anyway and what makes anyone think people polled are informed enough to know their heads from their posteriors. I mean 80% of Americans approved of the Iraq war when it started. Not to mention some people are pretty ignorant and probably never considered their own perspective or thought about it (look at how LSD and marijuana are banned when neither one are even remotely close to as harmful as alcohol or cigs). People also aren't number they're individuals with different view points, so using statistics to evaluate people  on an individual basis is a huge joke.    \n   \nb) Look at how badly the government screwed up obamacare's rollout. Being forced to try and withdraw yourself from the system could easily been insanely complicated regardless of what people may claim it's easy. If it may work somewhere else, doesn't mean it'll work in America. I personally wouldn't be surprised if it was as hard to do as cancelling AOL. Mindless bureaucracy screws people over, and so does the American government most of the time.   \n      \nC) A lot of people will  most likely end up not knowing the rules and end up just having their organs donated without even saying yes or no because they're in the system and don't know about it. How is that any different than rape? You don't consent and are just in the system, and you have to know to opt out. Look at how many people don't know the basic rules of the US government. At the very minimum people should have to sign a form at age 18 to consent either way similar to something like the selective service, so they actually know what the hell is going to happen to their own body.\n\nD) What about pluripotent stem cells or bionic organs or even nanotechnology to repair issues in organs? Why resort to mandatory consent without exhausting every other option first? Resorting to forced consent before at least trying other options fully is bad mojo, imagine if that is applied to any other legislation because \"it worked for organ donations\". I get the religious right have a kneejerk reaction to \"omg stem cells\", but honestly that's way better than having \"organ rape\".  \n\n \nE) I don't want my organs in someone else's body and will exercise everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen. Also adult life is all about artificial hardships and being totally unnecessarily complicated due to bs social constructions and limitations in the way people see themselves and others. Why would I want to make the average persons life easier by sacrificing a part of me considering medicine's primitive understanding of the complexities of the human body there may be a lot of issues or factors a person's organs predispose us to that we don't even know? Epigenetics is poorly understood, look at the bioinformatics information overload (basically there's huge databases  computing massive amounts of  that we don't understood). It probably won't even take 10 years for medicine's understanding to be turned upside down.  Even if I did donate organs why would I want them in an unknown person's body considering I know nothing about the other person, and the world is so fundamentally messed up that no amount of donating organs will solve the systematic oppression, inherently divisive nature of society, ignorance, mindless complications, exploitation of others, and constant pissing contests of who's inferior and who's superior that perfectly sum up a good portion of the world's interactions, especially in America? People are going to still be miserable, depressed, and suffering and no amount of automatically consented organs will ever change that until we address the fundamental inequalities within society. Why extend lives if the world is going to be just as messed up? A life lived to 100 in misery and suffering is no life lived at all. \n     \nF) Doctors who support this should should really consider distancing themselves from this perspective by realizing the history of medicine. It's not that different from how medicine had huge gains from literal grave robbing 100+ years ago. Taking organs from people who automatically consented is ridiculous.   "}

{"title": "CMV: In a capitalist society, it is completely reasonable for men to make more money than women.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_3633hr", "selftext": "This is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. \n\nThis needs to be prefaced by saying that all of this is based on averages, not individuals. I'm sure many women are more capable than many men, what I'm saying is that the general trend across the board is that on average a male worker is more productive. \n\nMen work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women.\n\nMen work more standard hours than women.\n\nWomen take more sick days off work than men.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work.\n\nA small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month.\n\nTo use anecdotal evidence, yesterday i came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well. I'm not talking about one or two co-workers here, there were 7 women on shift, and every single one of them followed this gender stereotyped idea of what closing responsibilities they should have. Its one thing if men and women divide tasks based on relative strengths and weaknesses, but if someone neglects to do a task because there's no one of the opposite sex to assign it to, that is ridiculous. When only men are closing, someone still ends up washing the dishes and shining the countertops. \n\n\nDue to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women. \n\nWhat I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue, I am met with incredible opposition, as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth is, an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay men and women equally. \n\nI am not saying that women *deserve* to be paid less because they have children for example, humanity needs new people to be born , and as such women should not be penalized for taking time off work to raise children. However, we do not live in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy, where employers are free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average, certainly not always, but on average, men can generate slightly more work and revenue than women. \n\nThus, the only way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation.

It's also harmful that unwanted men just go out there and try to sympathize with people who look down on them, looking for pity. I also think that no one will disagree with the fact that it's not as though as a few less men in the social spheres is going to change anything. In fact, it may even benefit women and other men, since they don't have to deal with people they don't like or who they look down on.\n\nIt's beneficial for those men who are considered losers, who are looked down on, to focus on improving their lives elsehow.

There's plenty of parts that don't require kissing and it's fairly easy to avoid.\n\nI feel that it's a special thing that should only occur between partners. I know and fully understand it's \"just a job\" but it still physically happens, that's the problem. I believe that kissing another human being really sends some emotional signals in the brain that can trigger attraction / connection and I know of several cases where a relationship on screen has led to a relationship off screen. I'm in a band and if we did a video where there was a situation where the director asked me to kiss another girl, I'd refuse. If I was an actor I'd refuse to kiss another girl. I know I should trust my girlfriend, but she has lied to me (only little ones I guess) on a few occasions recently. But I don't know who can be trusted, especially when I know that scientifically, kissing another human being makes changes in the brain and builds these connections. I still count it as cheating. But I don't want to stop her from doing anything. If we get married and spend the rest of our lives together then I'd want her to be my \"last first kiss\" and I'd epxect the same the other way round.\n\nI told her that there's loads of jobs available that don't require kissing (she seems to think she's never going to be offered those kinds of scenes anyway due to her being short). There's quite a few actors / actresses that refuse to do kissing scenes because they have a partner (e.g. Kirk Cameron). But I also said that I don't want to stop her from doing anything - if she wants / feels like she needs to do those scenes, then she should but we'd have to end the relationship. If she needs to do that then I'd prefer her to be happy, but I wouldn't want it to sacrifice my personal beliefs.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: I should eat Lunchables every day", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_361y9b", "selftext": "As an adult man who counts calories daily, I'm always trying to find food that is cheap and either easy to prepare or possible to prepare all at once at the start of the week. I've tried several alternatives including salads and slow cooked meat, but they tended to be expensive and not necessarily keep or reheat as well as I'd like.\n\nFor that reason, I present lunchables, specifically the cheese pizza kind, as the best choice for me for dinner. They are cheap, costing between $1 and $2 each depending on sales and how far I'm willing to drive to buy them. They keep in the refrigerator all week with no issue. They have only 270 calories, allowing me to supplement the meal in a number of ways without going over my daily limit. They have 16g protein, which is not as good as meat dishes but is still quite a bit. You prepare them as you eat them, which slows down the process, allowing you to feel more full. But they also require no heating and the additional prep time is minimal compared to many other meals.\n\nWhat it would take to change my view:\n\n1. An example of a better meal with similar or greater protein content and less than 400 calories that isn't too expensive\n\n2. A specific reason why eating them every day would be unhealthy. Not just general concerns about processed food, but a specific ingredient or other factor.\n\n3. Something else I haven't thought of\n\nWhat won't change my view:\n\n1. Subjective arguments about taste or repetitiveness. I enjoy the taste and actually prefer to eat the same thing every weekday.\n\n2. Anything involving chicken. I already have chicken for lunch every day, and that actually would be too repetitive.\n\nEdit: a lot of you have suggested I make my own lunchables and I've decided to do that thanks to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/361y9b/cmv_i_should_eat_lunchables_every_day/cr9yyu9) which gave me the best idea for a specific ingredient to provide the closest replacement.

Not too long ago, there was quite the controversy surrounding [this](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/13/living/feat-boston-university-saida-grundy-race-tweets/), and it spilled over into a Facebook debate amongst my fellow BU peers. It is here where I was made aware of the fact that, apparently, the dictionary definition of racism is pretty much obsolete, and \u2014more shockingly\u2014 that women cannot be sexist against men, much like black people cannot be racist against white people. \n\nI feel that, like [Ludwig Wittgenstein](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/), the meaning of words lies on a shared commonality \u2014be it community slang, or dictionary definitions\u2014 not on an individual's decision; e.g. I cannot expect that exclaiming \"look at that magnificent fan!\" should be interpreted by people as 'fan' meaning 'double rainbow', because that is not the agreed upon definition of 'fan.' [I use this example because it just seems to me that someone (presumably from tumblr or some radfem blog) decided to change the definition of racism\u2014 how convenient.]\n\nSo, change my view/educate me, because to me, racism is racism\u2014 regardless of the aggressor's race/skin color.\n\nEdit 1: So, just to clarify: the 'reverse,' to me, is nonsense. As I understand it, it is called reverse because in the history of USA, the most well-known and most abundant cases of racism has been from white people onto others. I'm not saying that other people have not been racist towards whites, that would be nonsense. To me, however, racism is racism, and there's no need for the 'reverse.' What I was trying to get at, is that a black/Asian/Hispanic/[minority] person CAN be racist towards whites\u2014 because the definition of racism is irrespective of the aggressor's race.\n\nEdit 2: Second clarification: by 'reverse racism' I mean that which is directed towards white people, as others have defined it\u2014 presumably because in the historical context of America, it has been white people who have harbored racism towards others.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Mandating vaccinations in kids is a terrible idea", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_360yjw", "selftext": "Hello! I understand the majority of reddit feels quite strongly about vaccinations and I believe my view is the opposite of many of yours. I hope you go into this with an open mind and I will return the favor. \n\nThe mandating of vaccinations would involve the government deciding what goes into a child's body. But I ask why shouldn't parents decide if they want to prevent something from entering their child's body? (Note: There is an argument to be made that parents shouldn't decide and the child should. However there are several important vaccinations that would occur prior to the child having the capacity to make such a decision. Polio Vaccine and Hepatitis B Vaccine come to mind. So either way someone is making that decision for the child. I believe that person should the parents or guardian - not the state.)\n\nWhy? Because parents are more so connected with their children than the government and therefore should be trusted to have their children's best interests in mind. Yes, sometimes parents are idiotic and make a health decision that is horrible and sometimes even fatal. However, the government has also been shown to not have the best health interests in its citizens at times. (See: Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment)\n\n\nBut at the end of the day, a parent not vaccinating their kids indirectly effects others. That has to count for something, right? Forcing vaccinations upon those who don't want it is for the greater good, right? Perhaps those thoughts are best summed up by Former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who once said, \"The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins.\" I'm sure he would have supported a mandate, which will likely reduce the suffering of many people, wholeheartedly for this reason. But also for this reason he supported the horrific Buck v. Bell decision (a decision that unfortunately still has support, particularly on reddit.)\n\nSee. That's the problem with doing things for the \"greater good\", it often doesn't accomplish much and reduces the rights of others. \n\nA final point I'd like to make would be to highlight the parallel between vaccinations and smoking. Yes there are efforts to curb the activity in public places (In my own city of Pittsburgh, they recently banned smoking in bars.) However, smoking still effects more people than just the user. Second hand smoke is a real thing and damages a person's health when they had to choice but to breathe it in. Perhaps you could say that it is avoidable and being in contact with unvaccinated people is unavoidable. But secondhand smoke is practically unavoidable. It can stay in an area for hours - long after the overbearing smell is gone. You wouldn't even know. But yet there is no real support for a general ban on smoking as there is with a mandate for vaccinations. \n\n\nJust to cover my bases, I 'd like to say I'm not anti-vaccine. I fully support vaccinations, am fully vaccinated, and if I were to be blessed enough to have my own children, I would have them vaccinated. I view this as a freedom issue (right to body) and not a vaccines are bad issue. I thank you all for reading and look for to any possible responses. \n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This leads many people to have at least a small bias is the idea that hiring a man will be more permanent and a higher chance of more potential profit in the long run.\n\nHowever, if the man who conceived the baby also got maternity leave, this would mean the risk is equal no matter what gender you hire. During maternity leave, the man would take care of the child with the woman, allowing for both of them to take care of the child, and allow the child to get more recognition of the father. \n\nThis may also help stopping the idea that a women is necessarily the one who has to take care of the child, another stereotype that is often regarded as bad.\n\nThis could also theoretically help with rare events such as when male homosexual couples get a women (who would not raise the child) to birth the child for them given that they can\u2019t.\n\nThis would ofcourse not solve all the problems with inequality in the genders, but I think this might be a good way to help (although since I\u2019m posting it here, obviously I\u2019m not /sure/ it\u2019s a good idea)\n "}

The current interest is LOW, if not negative in real terms. This means that there arn't sufficient (safe) borrowers to allocate the funds to. Increasing the savings more risks entering a liquidity trap.\n\n2) Stagnation of demand. If you encourage people to save then they arn't spending (obviously). This is probably the worst thing that could happen right now (or in the next few years). \n\n3) Asset price bubbles. With lots of savings being depositied banks will be forced to 'do' something with that money.  Some of the things they will do is buy assets, or lend to buyers of assets: such as Bonds, stocks, property. ect. Rapid increases in the purchase of these has historically lead to their prices becoming speculative. It also prices out of the market the very people who you are teaching should save: Young people. \n\n\nSo thats why  I think encouraging, on mass, a new generation of young people to start savings to that degree would end badly.\n\nI want to understand why others think it shoudl be encouraged so I'm posting here.

Here is a link to watch it if you haven't seen it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhKAQX5izw\n\nHere is the gist of my viewpoint:\nIn the US, when a person is terminated from a job, he/she is entitled to unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks or until they are employed again. Workers and companies pay into this and, while many people end up taking more than they give, it is the system we have and it seems to work for the majority of people here. When a person leaves a job VOLUNTARILY, however, they are not entitled to unemployment benefits. If you quit a job to go to another job this is fine. If you are quitting to go 'find' yourself in Australia for a year, you better have a financial plan because you can't live off other peoples' money for your vacation. This system also seems to work well for most people.\n\nIn the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.\n\nMy stance is that if having a child is a choice, it should be one the parents must prepare for financially before making - just like if they wanted to voluntarily take time off work for other reasons.\n\nWe have safety nets for people who are caught in situations they can't control. This is not one of them. Being a parent requires the ability to plan and budget anyway, and it includes many expenses that people will absolutely incur that will not be covered by the hard work of others. It should start with planning to be off work for whatever time having the baby takes.\n\nI completely support peoples' positions being protected while they are off and, quite honestly, think that length of time should be extended from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. But I REALLY don't like the idea of taxpayer dollars being used to support ANYONE who voluntarily leaves work - no matter the reason.\n\nChange My View.\n\nEDIT: I am also against he government mandating that companies provide paid maternity leave on simple Constitutional grounds. In the US the Constitution prohibits the government from mandating this. But I would LOVE it if companies started doing it voluntarily and think it would be a huge positive for attracting top talent. But it should be between employers and employees to figure out compensation packages. \n\n\n__________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

[Here's a banned TED talk by Rupert Sheldrake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg) on a so-called \"science delusion\" (a play on the \"God Delusion\"). While I do not agree with him entirely, I think he poses a very important point. The materialist worldview it has come to is very limiting compared to the original intent of the scientific method.\n\nMy view is that while we can be taught, it is up to us to learn through our own experiences and choose whether or not to accept the said teachings, as opposed to blind faith. However, I feel this is a dangerous view to have as it is not only is a rebellious one, but also heavily degrades my respect for the Abrahamic religions and a good chunk of the scientific community. I'd really like to see the other side of this.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The only thing you need to meet my definition of \"slut\" here is that you have a lot of sex with different partners. \n\nAlthough it might help to draw a distinction between purely voluntary \"sluts\" and the psychologically damaged sort, I don't think it's necessary to make my overall point.\n\nHere's my justification:\n\n1. Sluts tend to have more sex, which is good not only in a physical sense, but also in a self esteem sense. Getting laid makes a person feel better about themselves, and sluts make more people feel better about themselves. Because of all this sex, they also feel better, themselves, (in a raw physical sense) which has some value on a utilitarian-style analysis.\n\n2. \"Sluts\" tend not to perpetuate stringent and repressive standards of beauty, because they'll have sex with a wider range of individuals. We all know some starry-eyed individual who is saving themselves for *just* the right person, where that person has to meet incredibly particular criteria. But we could also include people who are simply very particular on physical grounds, such as people who absolutely will not date people who lack certain physical characteristics (not skinny enough, not tall enough, etc.).\n\nWe might also say that \"sluts\" make fewer people feel badly about their own attractiveness level, because the range of people they'll have sex with is wider.\n\nLet's start with this basic stuff. I imagine we can get to further points through discussion.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Morality is important to our survival as a species. If we didn't have morality, then why would we, as human beings, ever look out for one another? Why would we care if someone else was hurt? At the end of the day, wouldn't we be only concerned about ourselves? \n\n\nKeep in mind that when I am talking about morality, I am talking about it as a person who hasn't studied philosophy. I am talking about it the way your average person would. I am using it to mean, \"the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.\" Those distinctions will be different from person to person, but those distinctions still exist. Also, I think the generally understood definition of being \"moral\" is to help others to the best of your ability, to protect others before yourself, to minimize harm done to others. Basically, to protect the flock. \n\nHowever [another discussion on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35y0qf/cmv_some_opinions_are_ethically_right_and_can/) has made me start doubting morality even exists. I am having a hard time wrapping my head around this one way or another, and at this point (as another commenter has put it) I've broken through the Matrix into the Real World. So loyal readers of Change My View: break my spirit. Tell me why morality doesn't exist. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

That is the creation of Artificial General Intelligence or Artificial Strong Intelligence, whatever you want to call it.\n\nFirst, you have to contend with the issue of whether or not you believe human or greater than level intelligence can even be created. Which I think most people would agree that it is possible, or at least there is nothing fundamental about intelligence that requires it to exist only in humans, or a biological substrate as opposed to some other.\n\nNow, if you do accept that AGI is possible, you must then consider when you think it may be created and whether you or your direct descendants will be affected, if it happens 10,000 years from now, no one alive today would (or really should) care in the slightest. The issue is that unless you are directly involved in the field itself, coming up with a realistic timetable is a difficult problem. Fortunately for us laypeople (myself included), a survey was conducted at a conference of AI experts a few years ago, and concluded that the median optimistic year (10% likelihood) for AGI was 2022, the median realistic year (50% likelihood) was 2040, and the median pessimistic year (100% likelihood) was 2075. Now you are free to disagree with their predictions, but you'd better have damn good cause to do so and be takes seriously by other people. \n\nAll of this taken together has forced me to the realization that there can be no useful forecasting of the near or long term future without considering the impact AGI could have on it. But further to this, no one can even make a solid guess as to what might happen if one is created! There is speculation, some good and some bad, but ultimately this event, the singularity, has an apt name for a reason, we have no prior history or examples from which to learn from! And then, to top it all off, an AGI would likely quickly surpass human intelligence if given the resources, not to mention it may think in such a way that humans could not even follow its logic or reasoning.\n\nTL;DR: So all of this is to say, if you believe AGI is possible, and if you believe that it could come into existence in the nearish future, there is no way to make any easy generalizations about what the future might be like. We have no idea what's coming, and too many people are not factoring in the disruption an AGI could cause, whether for good or ill. Essentially, not enough people are taking this possibility seriously enough, and we're making plans about the future that are affecting people today without taking into account the most profound event in human history.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While I'll conceed that some of the big roundabouts like some of the ones in Paris would be a lot safer if they were intersections. I still firmly believe that roundabouts in general are better.\n\n\nRoundabouts are more fuel efficient since you aren't waiting around for the lights to change. \n\nRoundabouts are safer for pedestrians. I don't know how many times I've almost been hit when I'm crossing the street at a traffic light intersection and a car is still allowed to go because they are still allowed to cross the street I am walking. Roundabouts have cars coming from one way and then you usually have a place in the middle where they're coming from the other way making it easier for people to cross the street safely. \n\nThey are also more cost effective since you don't have to pay to keep the lights running. (At least with the smaller roundabouts. Some of the ones I've seen in the UK also incorporate lights in their roundabouts but this is for highly congested areas)\n\nEdit:\nAlright I fell asleep and I'm just reading all the comments now. \nRoundabouts are safer for pedestrians maybe not for the reasons I listed but /u/scottevil110 has given a resource proving that they saw a 75% drop in pedestrian accidents. \nhttp://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/roundabouts/qanda\n\nAlso my argument is assuming that both ways are used correctly so everyone can stop pointing out that North Americans don't know how to use them.\n\nI will agree that traffic lights do have merit and have their places like in places I hadn't considered like densely populated areas and I also did not account for how much land the roundabouts would take up when compared to an intersection. However I still think in the long run the electricity cost would eventually over take the extra cost of the land. "}

He has escaped countless times, and every time, Batman has to go recapture him (after he's killed or injured who-knows-how-many people). \n\nOstensibly, Batman's no-killing policy is a self imposed check on his inner demons that he is sure will consume him if he gives into them. I believe that, in reality, he uses this policy as a security blanket he can cling to so that he doesn't have to get his hands dirty and make a difficult decision. I think he wraps up his own cowardice in a cloak of self-righteousness (albeit a fireproof, bulletproof cloak).\n\nHere are my main views\n\n1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill or permanently incapacitate him\n\n2) Batman has a moral obligation to kill or incapacitate the Joker since the state can't or won't do it.\n\n3) He bares responsibility for everyone the Joker harms.\n\n**Important Points** \n\n* The Joker is responsible for everyone he kills. The full burden of each person's murder is on his head. This CMV in no way negates his responsibility for his actions.\n\n* Batman is **not** equally as responsible as the Joker for the people he kills. I'm not attempting to assign a specific amount of blame to Batman. All I am saying is that he bares some level of responsibility for his refusal to stop the Joker.\n\n* Finally, Batman is not responsible for the people that the Joker killed early on in his career before it became apparent that he could not be contained. \n\n**Edit**\n\n* If you are against capitol punishment or killing in general, we obviously have an unbridgeable gap here, and cannot possibly come to an agreement\n\n* The only criminal that I am applying this argument to is the Joker.

{"title": "CMV: Nuclear war in the near future is inevitable until virtually all such weapons are eliminated.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35rkzr", "selftext": "By near future, I mean 0 to 100 years. Given the irrationality of humanity, and the long history of systemic failures leading to the unthinkable, the presence of nuclear weapons represents an existential risk that is all too plausible.\n\nThe total yield of all nuclear weapons is measured in the *gigatons*. Though work has been done in the area of disarmament, the pace is far too slow to be meaningful. Even the presence of 20 modern nuclear weapons is an intolerable threat. \n\nBut a nuclear war involving only 20 weapons is a pipe dream. There are thousands of 'active' nuclear weapons, ready to be deployed, and at the current pace of disarmament, any nuclear war within the next 100 years will involve *at least* hundreds of weapons, with a total explosive yield in the hundreds of megatons.\n\nEven one is too many. If, for example, terrorists detonated a nuclear weapon of moderate yield in Manhattan, simulations have shown a total fatality amount of nearly a million. Economic damage due to both direct and indirect effects would likely be in the trillions. Geopolitics would be utterly and irreversibly destabilized for the foreseeable future. North Korea and Iran would suddenly appear to require immediate military intervention to forestall future attacks, and the American public would gladly endorse it.\n\nThis even would represent one of the greatest calamities in human history. Yet the threat of this pales when compared with a nuclear war involving multiple nations. In a full-scale nuclear war, immediate causalities would be in the hundreds of millions, potentially rising to billions depending on the extent of the war and the resulting collapse of infrastructure and climate stability. The very concept of a global economy would cease to exist. Humanity would be plunged into internecine conflict for decades, possibly centuries, as those still alive fought tooth and claw over the rubble of civilization. Suffice to say, short of an asteroid impact on the scale of Chicxulub, it is hard to imagine a worse fate for mankind.\n\nNow, let me address the problem of mutually assured destruction. This subject really requires its own topic, but I'll try to be as concise as I can. All major nuclear arsenals are organized around this idea, and so they are kept ready at all times, waiting for the call. This is insanely dangerous, as it means any mistake or false positive will not simply cause some weapons to be launched in retaliation, but *all* weapons. Implicit in the idea of MAD is that any nuclear strike must be responded to with overwhelming force, and the response must happen **immediately**, long before the bombs start going off.  A submarine-launched ballistic missile would take less than 15 minutes to reach a major city - that is the window our leaders have to judge if an attack is real or imaginary. Mistakes and false positives of this kind [have already happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov), and will surely happen in the future. We only need be unlucky once. \n\nIf that weren't bad enough, we have the growing danger of missile defense initiatives, which although perhaps well-intentioned, serve to destabilize the already questionable state of nuclear deterrence. What happens when, for one country, MAD is no longer mutual? If you believe your only true means of defense is being taken from you, what response do you have left?\n\nBut here is what is really scary, what should truly frighten you: it doesn't frighten you at all. This is the great paradox of nuclear war. It is simply too big to fathom. Just like attempting to imagine the scale of the universe, our minds fail us. Because we cannot imagine it, we dismiss it as a kind of fantasy. I am guilty of this too. Here I am, writing this post with all sincerity, and yet to contemplate it doesn't disturb me one bit. Of course it won't happen, right?\n\nI feel that this is the true peril we are facing. While our leaders may understand the threat intellectually, they have no visceral reaction to it. Not the reaction required to affect the needed changes to remove the threat. As history teaches us, world leaders are perpetually blindsided by what seems so obvious in hindsight.\n\nWe saw this with WWI: who would have thought one assassination would lead to a war killing millions? We saw this with 9/11: who would have thought it was so trivial to use commercial jets as weapons? We saw this with credit default swaps: who would have thought how easily they would cause systemic collapse of the economy? Who would have thought...\n\nThis where we are right now. The weapons are here, they are ready. The trigger need only the lightest pressure. And you aren't worried, you aren't worried at all.\n\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Every side has this one up mentality where everyone tries to be as much of a victim as possible, to make their statements somewhat count more or have more importance, while the other side tries to play down those statements.\n\nI'd like to mention, that this all goes for middle class western society (most of what is reddits demography).\n\nHere comes my problem: It seems to me, that both genders are trying to compare apples and oranges when it comes down to who has it worse. Its impossible. Both sides are so different from each other, both sides suffer from different problems both sides have different advantages. How could that be compared? Who decideds what problem is really worse then the other one? It can't be done. No human being has the ethical superiority to define which problem is worse. And its far more complex than just comparing two problems together. Its a huge set of things that has to be considered for each gender, and it is impossible to make an overall statement because of the complexity and variance between those two sides.\n\nOne big attribution to this kind of thinking is lack of empathy on both sides. Its simply to explain why this lack of empathy exists. Very few people get the actual living experience of both sides of this story, because normally people do not live as the opposite gender they are born as. So almost all people lack experiences of living as the opposite gender they are born as, and therefore have a very narrow experience on gender related issues. The typical grass is greener on the other side occurs.\n\nWhat most forget, is how really different the living experiences of an average women is compared to an average men. I won't deny many of thoses differences exist because of some stupid cultural gender norms, but many do not. Many can be attributed to other stuff like biological imperatives. I am not saying that those contribute equally as hard to every individual, that is not true. Its a spectrum for everyone. But overall, the experiences differ between the genders, and thats why its a comparission of apples and oranges.\n\nHow can someone compare thoses difference experiences as a whole and say one is better and the other is worse? It can't even be done on an individual level, how is it possible to compare such huge groups as men and women?\n\nI don't like the way the equality discussion is going, but i would be open minded to someone who can explain, why comparing men and women lifes is even possible.\n\nI will try to argue against every statement that goes like: \"But look, gender x has it worse here and there and there, thats why they have it worse in general.\" I will simply counter it with a list of disadvantages of the other gender, and ask you to compare what is worse. You will notice that it simply can't be done. If someone provides me happiness statistics, then i have some arguments against that too, don't even bother.\n\nTl,dr: Mens life and womens life are not comparable. Why can someone say one side has it worse than the other when there is no comparable ground?\n"}

I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. \n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school.\n\nEvery morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 50/50 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0+ gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the \"best\" colleges and a majority of them will not make it.\n\nI think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0+ gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0+ gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the advice guys. It's been very helpful and I'll be visiting this thread in the future when my determination will inevitably falter. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: More bad than good would result from restaurant servers being paid a wage as opposed to working for tips.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35nsoi", "selftext": "This is a relatively hot topic with all of the minimum wage reform in discussion. A lot of people think servers should be paid a \"living wage\" instead of working for tips.  Here is why I think this is a horrible idea:\n\n-Restaurant prices would increase.  In most of the country, servers are paid $2.13 per hour.  If it were raised to say $15, restaurants would likely try to make up the majority of this increase through increased prices.\n\n-People would lose jobs.  Restaurants would likely staff less servers. They would either do this by making servers work harder (for less money), or increased automation. \n\n-Servers like being paid in tips.  Good servers are making plenty of money.   I personally know servers who average $25 per hour, working 40 hours per week.  Yes, it all depends on the restaurant you work at but that goes with any profession.  A marketer will make more money with a good firm than a crappy one.  Same with lawyers; professors, mechanics, etc. \n\n-our current tipping system results in servers giving better service because they are trying to earn better tips. \n\n-The tip system works as a type of commission system for restaurants, as people generally too based off of their total bill. This encourages servers to \"upsell\" drinks, appetizers, desserts, etc. without this commission system servers are less likely to push these products as it won't directly affect their income. Restaurants will have to make up for lost sales somehow else. "}

I'll break this into two parts to meet the sub's 500 character limit, part II being in the comments section:\n\n**Part I**\n\nSome people absolutely love TNG. For many, it\u2019s their introduction to Star Trek. This makes no sense as even TNG\u2019s writing staff have come forward complaining that Gene Roddenberry thoroughly tied their hands and forced the show to have zero conflict, zero drama, and to resemble his vision of a utopian future, by force mind you. Gene forced the staff, fans of TOS wishing to pay homage to the series, to create utopia against their will via his absolute authority as the creator (cutting out the influence of men like ~~Trotsky~~ D.C. Fontana or Gene Coon, and crowning himself grand chancellor or Star Trek). Let this be a foreshadowing to the sort of show that would unfold.\n\nEven beyond it\u2019s creation, if taken seriously as canon, TNG represents a dystopian future. Take the NCC-1701 Enterprise-D for example. The original Enterprise was just one of an historic line of ships, form the Earth seas to the stars. So why the Enterprise-D, with the same number and name? Why no other ship? Why no Constellation-D, or NCC-1700 Constitution-D? There is no other explanation: It was pure propaganda."}

Voluntaryism is a political philosophy with two main points; all interactions should be voluntary by all parties, and everyone should abide by the non-aggression principle (people can not threaten, force, or coerce another person, for that is violent). \nTo get it strait, I believe anarchism is only associated with chaos for the reason that the polar opposite of anarchy, the state, has been in power for thousands of years and is the ones to educate people since then.\nI believe that the state itself is a hypocrisy; no man can be trusted to rule himself, so lets have someone from this group rule everyone.\nI believe that taxation is theft on the grounds that they do not ask for your consent when they take your money, and is immoral no matter what the money is used for.\nI believe that arresting is kidnapping, especially when it comes to lawbreakers, who I define as those who commit victimless crimes, compared to criminals who commit crimes with victims. To be honest, my views here are somewhat fuzzy.\nThough I am absolutely not against learning and education, I am against state-based education. I find it violent through coercion. I or my parents could be fined or jailed because I want to take complete charge in my own education or just don't want to be educated in a place that indoctrinates patriots from an age where we can't argue well against it?\nI do not believe that technological advancement will halt in any major way.\nI do not believe that electricity, sewage, internet and the like will go away at all without government. Well, it's possible in a place where the government controls everything, but not entirely, I believe.\nI am against the police because they have the legal right to kill you for what a couple documents say. People should only have the right to kill another individual as a last option in defense of yourself or someone else. No one should have the right to kidnap or kill you for a victimless crime. (Again, somewhat of a fuzzy area, especially when it comes to rapists or murderers.)\nI believe that laws are nothing but threats. \u201cIf you do this, then we have the right to go as far as to kill you.\u201d That sounds completely immoral, using threats to keep someone from doing something. \nI do not think people are any less safe in the long term if anarchy suddenly reigned on mankind. In fact, I believe that there will be a much stronger sense of community without a state, and a greater sense of protection.\nI am sure I missed some points here, and I apologize if this seems too long.

{"title": "CMV: Prescriptivism", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_35mgfp", "selftext": "I've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as \"correct\" language, that what prescriptivists call \"mistakes\" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.\n\nLinguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single \"correct\" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly \"incorrect\" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.\n\nBut. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any \"correct\" language. For example:\n\n\"He _went_ to the shops\"\n\"He _gone_ to the shops\"\n\nI can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of \"go\" is \"gone\" instead of \"went\". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:\n\n\"Shops went the he to\"\n\nThis isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than \"incorrect\"? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.\n\nSo what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as \"wrong\". Please VCM.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

In fact the LDS (Mormon) church even bought ads in the Playbills of the musical to direct the audience to the official LDS website. Prominent political figures such as Hilary Clinton have also seen the play and didn't have any issues about it.\n\nYet at the same time there are certain religions in the United States that are big no-no's to make fun of.  This seems slightly counter intuitive. \n\nI only have the view from a Mormon perspective but there have been other pieces of media that openly mock and slap at Mormons including [this](http://images.politico.com/global/2012/07/bbw_mormonempire_cover29.jpg) from the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek. For a little bit of background on this cover and what it is depicting. That is Joseph Smith who is the founder of the Mormon church along with another member of the church receiving a blessing from an angel.  Obviously this angel did not say those things that are on the cover and disputing what the cover brings up is a topic for a different subreddit, so please don't address those things, but know that this cover is offensive to most Mormons. This scene in Mormon theology is as sacred as Moses receiving the ten commandments or Buddha reaching Nirvana. \n\nSo I guess I'm just trying to understand why its acceptable to harshly mock some religions (not just Mormons) but not others.\n\nTL;DR Why is it politically correct to never criticize one religion but its okay to criticize another?\n\n\n\nEdit: /u/nosotros_road_sodium explained it the best with the [Punch UP vs Punch Down idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35md5x/cmv_mainstream_acceptance_of_the_book_of_mormon/cr5qlbl).

Going in you know what is going to happen, and you are just watching it unfold. There may be times of error, dripping of paint, or cracking, but in the end the wall is painted.\n\nGame of Thrones is similar in that there is only one conclusion to the story, and while you may watch some of the paint drip, in the end you will see it dry and nothing else mattered.\n\nIn the first or second book/season in this series we learn that there is undead coming from the north to end the world. The only way to defeat them is unite the seven kingdoms and defeat them with dragons. This means that only one person can do this: Daenerys. Not a single other person has dragons. That mean there is only two possible conclusions to the Game of Thrones; Everyone dies, or Daenerys unites the kingdom and wins the war. I doubt anyone would bother with the story if the first happens.\n\nThis means there is only one conclusion to the story. Nothing else matters. Every other character is unimportant, and will die now, submit to the queen or die in the war. Every villain in the series will die and everything they do is meaningless, as the only evil is the undead. All the story lines will end before the final war with their conclusions being meaningless in the conclusion of the story. Who cares who is in power if we all know there is only one person who wins in the end? Therefore every minor story line has only one conclusion, they die or submit the queen, none of their goals of power can ever be fulfilled. There is only one person who can win or the world is destroyed. \n\nJust like the wall being painted, the story will end with a simple conclusion, all those cracks and drips are forgotten as the wall is done and they never meant anything. The wall is the white we painted it in the beginning and now it is dry, nothing else effected it in any way.\n\nAll watching the show is watching a long drawn out conclusion. Hell in the books, you can tell they made George add some other Targaryen, the once dead kid, because there was no mystery what so ever and no real reason to continue reading the books. People who watch the TV show are easy going, they did not need to add that mystery because people are content watching the paint dry.\n\nJust like the paint, there is only one color, one ending, and one person who matters. Everyone else is just paint waiting to dry, never changing the known conclusion, just passing the time. Watching the show is watching these characters slowly dry the white you know they will with no mystery as there is only one possible conclusion. CMV\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly:\n\n1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90%) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in.\n\n2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner.\n\n3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with #1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form.\n\nI think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of. I think that's hard to argue against but also really depressing, so change my view. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: \"Not All X\", such as \"Not all men\" has a small, but important place in gender equality discussion.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_35k9i9", "selftext": "Hi! I'm trying to learn feminism -- which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for the \"not all men\" sentiment. \n\nI'd like to start out by establishing a few things, because it's important to know that I don't support using this sentiment broadly.\n\n1. Where a victim is grieving, confiding, venting, or however else they are dealing with a problem, it is an inappropriate time to use \"not all men\". The focus belongs on the victim and their healing at that time, not nitpicking their wording.\n2. \"Not all men\", in the way I'm using it here, is actually \"not all X\", where X is any group in a discussion that has a broad, negative statement said toward their group. We see it most frequently thanks to the (most often deserving) scorn targeted at the \"not all men\" sentiment, but I do mean Not all X, where X is any group.\n\n###The value of accurate language\n\nAs a young boy, when I said \"women are bad at math\", my father corrected me. He said \"some women are bad at math\". When my brother said \"you never let me go to town,\" he corrected him by saying \"I usually don't, but here are the times I did\". My father took issue with \"global\" language, as he called it, no matter what form it came in, because he saw it as harmful.\n\nHave you ever felt a burden to prove you're some blanket statements that was often leveled against your kind? \"Women are bad at math\", or \"women cry so easily\", or \"blacks are stupid\", or \"feminist hate men\". For me personally, when I saw \"men are so shallow\" growing up I felt a sense of hostility from the statement. It felt like a judgement against me, and I felt like I had to carry the burden to show people that even though men are shallow, I'm a man and I'm not.\n\nThe point is, if we use careful speech, like \"I hate it when men are shallow / some men are so shallow\", OR \"It really bothers me a woman cries over the smallest thing\" and \"some women cry so easily\", we avoid creating broad, negative labels.  These labels can create a great sense of shame in the targeted group, and this shame fosters a sense of otherness. Instead of the shamed person feeling included or a part of something, they feel excluded. This, and the shame can also sabotage a person's self value and chance at success.\n\nBy biggest concern is the sense of otherness it can create, driving away potential allies, and by god we need a lot of allies to address the institutionalized racism and sexism in most western nations.\n\n**Therefore**\n\n1. I believe it is in the best interest of those seeking to address an oppressive culture to use accurate language in order to be inclusive to as many as possible, to maximize their efforts\n2. Just as it is the responsibility of the privileged to not use broad, negative language to describe the oppressed, it's also (far down on the priority list) the responsibility of the oppressed to not use broad, negative language to describe the privilege. Because, really, it's a human's responsibility to a human to not use broad, negative language against a human. To a reasonable length, of course,  and I d not believe adding \"some\" before men, women, asians, etc, is much of a stretch.\n\n###Picking an appropriate time\n\nAgain, the time to say \"not all X\" is not when a victim is trying to overcome their harm. But in casual conversation, as a small aside, it is good for all people to correct others when they use this harmful, broad language.\n\n####Conclusion / TL;DR: No matter the group, broad language assigning negative traits to another group is harmful, and it is our responsibility as humans to take reasonable efforts to avoid propagating this harm, starting first with ourselves, second in mild conversation, and never while a victim is trying to overcome harm. We should never become comfortable using broad, negative language.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Ar first I really enjoyed the discussion and community. But the longer I stayed I started to notice more and more problems. My biggest gripe with Reddit is the downvote system. I think the upvote concept is good, but not the reverse. As I've noticed, the community tends to silence people they dislike, or have a differing opinion with. This to me goes against the whole concept of Reddit. Content should not be silenced simply because you have a differing opinion. This is why so much of the same content cycles back to the top every now and then. To truly spark discussion and promote diversity, the tool should be removed completely. Though the true problem lies with the users, since they maintain this environment. But just like laws to protect citizens from having their rights taken, equal opportunity to have your voice heard should be a priority. \n\nBut that's just me.

FGM doesn't always involve the complete removing of the clitoris. It's not comparable to chopping off the head. There are four types of FGM. There is one type where the whole clitoris is removed, but others involve the removal of the clitoral hood, and others are comparable to the removal of foreskin. Circumcision supposedly lowers the risk of the contraction of HIV. The lifetime risk of HIV for men is 2%, and with the use of condoms, it can be 0%. If you get circumcised and still wear condoms... well.... what's the point? Now consider the risk of breast cancer for women, which is 12.4 percent for women born in the united states. Removal of the breast buds at birth could prevent this entirely, but nobody would actually want to do that.Just to clarify, circumcision for whatever medical reason as a child or later in life isn't nearly as bad. You can consent to it, and it's for a real health concern, unlike most cases with infant circumcision. An adult could choose to get circumcised if he wanted to. But does forcing genital mutilation on a baby for cultural or religious purposes make sense anymore? By definition, circumcision is mutilation, and in the vast majority of cases doesn't have any real health benefit. It's also not done for health, but cultural purposes in many cases. \n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/en/\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast/risk-fact-sheet\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Pro-vaxxers and anti-vaxxers are both fear-mongerers.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35io9o", "selftext": "Most of Reddit seems to be very pro-vaccine, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But here's where I stand on the issue. I believe that most people should get vaccinated, and we should definitely persuade people to do so because they do cause more good than harm, but I am against mandatory vaccinations because 1) I believe it's an issue of personal choice and 2) I was harmed by a vaccine when I was very young, and I know a few people who were as well, and I think doctors need to stop pretending that all vaccines are entirely harmless.\n\nA lot of the anti-vaxxers still perpetuate the myth that vaccines cause autism, which has been disproven several times. I have Aspberger's Syndrome and even I don't believe this anymore. Anti-vaxxers seem to have what is called confirmation bias, where they cling to their belief so much that any opposing arguments just do not register to them, and they will only bother looking at viewpoints that support their belief, because it makes them feel good. \n\nHowever, while pro-vaxxers tend to be a little better at acknowledging other points of view, a lot of them still have this mentality that anyone who questions the pharmaceutical industry at all must be an ignorant dumbass who doesn't know anything. This is simply not true. Since when is it wrong to question the intent of large businesses like the pharmaceutical companies? Now I don't subscribe to the anti-vax belief that these companies are trying to poison us or anything, but is it too far-fetched to say that since they are for-profit companies, making money does come first and foremost and effectiveness second? I'm not denying that they are expert scientists who are working to make them as effective as possible, but effectiveness sure isn't a requirement for them to make money. [And since they can't get sued for any vaccine injuries](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-vaccine-ruling-parents-cant-sue-drug-makers-for-kids-health-problems/), they have very little incentive to make sure their vaccines aren't causing any damage. The government is protecting them instead of protecting us.\n\n*Now regardless of how you feel about what I said above*, you must admit that many of the pro-vaxxers can be extremely judgmental towards the vaccine skeptics, making heartless and cruel statements like \"Any parent who doesn't vaccinate their children should have their kids taken away from them.\" *Really?* Let's break this down. You're saying that just because there's a small chance that an unvaccinated child will get some sort of disease, an even smaller chance that he will spread it to others before the disease is noticed, and an even smaller chance that the disease would be life-threatening, you think that's bad enough for a parent to be taken away from their children!? You think that's worse than people who smoke around their kids? Do you think parents who are bad drivers and could get their kids killed in an accident are any better? **I'm sorry but unless a parent is beating or abusing their child, you have no fucking right to say whether that parent deserves to be with his/her kids.** \n\nI have no problem with people telling others \"Vaccines are beneficial to society and I believe more people need to get vaccinated so we can get rid of disease.\" But when you call people like me \"a walking disease\" and claim that I'm putting everyone at my school at risk every day just because I'm not vaccinated, I'm sorry but that's bullshit. Sure, there's a slightly higher risk of me getting sick but you can't act like it's inevitably going to happen just because I'm not vaccinated. Vaccinations aren't the only way of getting rid of disease. [Look at this measles mortality graph from 1900.](http://healthimpactnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/11/G14.7-US-Measles-RM-1900-1987.png) The vaccine definitely helped, but measles was on its way down before the vaccine as well. \n\nAnother side note, I've heard that the United States currently has a more aggressive vaccine schedule than everywhere else in the world. I don't remember where I heard this. If someone wants to dispute this, be my guest.\n\n**My main two points are**, 1) Anti-vaxxers do spread mistruths and lies about vaccines (which we can all agree on), but 2) pro-vaxxers over-exaggerate the necessity for vaccines, and unnecessarily shame those who don't get vaccinated as if it's the end of the world. I am neither pro-vaccine nor anti-vaccine. [Please watch this video with Bill Maher, as it sums up my beliefs perfectly](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-im-not-an-anti-vaxxer-but/). (I don't care what you think about Bill Maher, watch it anyway just so you can understand where I'm coming from). As Marianne Williamson states in the video, \"There's a difference between having skepticism about science and having skepticism about the pharmaceutical industry.\" \n\nI know this is a sensitive topic. Please don't comment by attacking me for my beliefs. Do not compare me to a climate change denier. I just want to have a civil discussion about this, and since I'll admit I still don't know much about the issue, I'm very open to learning more about science and vaccines. Educate me, Reddit! :)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: The writers of Charlie Hebdo are heroes, and those who do not recognize this are ignorant fools", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35ie6g", "selftext": "At the beginning of this year, multiple staff members at Charlie Hebdo were slaughtered in their offices. The reason for their murders were due to cartoons they published - satirizing the prophet Muhammed. Whilst the majority of people I've seen have been firmly in Charlie Hebdo's camp, there seems to be a noticeable backlash against Charlie Hebdo and some of the things they've done - to the extent that people have protested against PEN's (a freedom of speech organisation) decision to award them honours. I want to address some of these claims.\n\nA Guardian article recently had this to say about CH:\n\n&gt;The narrative of the Charlie Hebdo murders \u2013 white Europeans killed in their offices by Muslim extremists \u2013 is one that feeds neatly into the cultural prejudices that have allowed our government to make so many disastrous mistakes in the Middle East\n\nFirst issue - this is a complete dehumanization of the staff who lost their lives that day. Suddenly, a murder becomes a narrative; that way, we don't have to see it as a crime. Furthermore, I imagine that Mustapha Ourad, copy editor of Charlie Hebdo, would be surprised to hear that he is white (if he were alive to hear it).\n\nThere are these claims that the writers at CH are racists (a claim that is demonstrably wrong, as I shall go on to explain), who oppress 'marginalized' peoples with cartoons. I suppose the people who make these claims either simply ignore, or do not see, the fact that the people who killed the cartoonists are very, very, very obviously racists themselves - demonstrated by their targeting of a Jewish community following the attack on CH - making them authentic, evidently racist killers. No one mentions that part of the 'narrative', do they?\n\nThe claim that CH is racist is an absurd one. I'll demonstrate why. Take this image from the [New Yorker](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/files/2015/04/original.jpg). Say you knew nothing of The New Yorker or wider US culture. What do you think this image conveys? That the New Yorker thinks Obama is a terrorist - that would be the only logical conclusion you could deduce.\n\nThe real purpose of that image is to parody the extreme right wingers of US politics and their claims about Obama - tea party claims that he is a terrorist, muslim, and unable to stand for presidency. To understand this, you require an understanding of current US political culture.\n\nNow, take this [widely circulated cover of CH's apparent racism](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2925558/CHARLIE-HEBDO.0.jpg). It shows Boko Haram sex slaves shouting 'Don't touch our welfare'. Now, imagine you have no understanding of Frances wider political culture of CH. What do you think this image conveys? That CH is a racist, right wing magazine.\n\nNow, if you *did* happen to possess an understanding of Charlie Hebdo and France's wider political culture; you'd immediately understand that the image is doing something extremely similar to the one on the New Yorker. It's parodying the extreme paranoia of the right wing, anti immigration parties that began to arise in France by displaying enslaved, pregnant, Boko Haram sex slaves invading France and taking their money.\n\nAnyone with any understanding of French culture and CH know for a fact that CH is a left wing magazine that has routinely expressed their desire for immigrants to remain in their country, and that the rights of immigrants be respected. Ignorant people with no prior knowledge of parisian culture, of the history of CH, make these absurd, disgusting, disrespectful claims about CH.\n\n&gt;'attacking marginalized peoples' - muslims\n\nFirstly, if attacking 'marginalized peoples' is such a major issue - then their would be zero criticism, parody, or satire from the left aimed at the working class peoples who voted for the Tea Party, Ukip, of the French NF. Is that the case? If Tea Partiers, or the French NF, had gunned down CH - would their be claims that CH's vicious attacks on their ideology lay hold to the blame of the attacks? Would that argument be defended?\n\nThe people who argue this way must therefore agree that there is an Islamic blasphemy law that is enforced at gunpoint - regardless of whether a population wants it - and that you are to blame if you are slaughtered for saying something other people don't like.\n\nCharlie Hebdo was a beacon of light, a welcome friend, and an invaluable ally to moderate and liberal Muslims across the globe. \n\n&gt;Islam\n\nIslam has no special place. It should receive the same level of parody, criticism, satire, and insults that every other religion and ideology has - if not more so given it's followers reluctance to accept this. It's followers have no right to demand people not to write this way. Muslims have zero right to murder those who don't believe the same things as they do, or insult the things they believe. Muslims who support those who commit these murders are equally as disgusting and retched as those who commit them. \n\n&gt;but you shouldn't hurt peoples feelings!\n\nYou also shouldn't kill people. This is not an argument I take seriously - Islam *needs* criticism, parody, and satire, and muslims need to see it, in order to understand that in Western Countries, this is an important aspect of our culture. Islam is not above reproach, it is not above satire. The reason for the killings given doesn't even make sense anyway - Islam restricts muslims from drawing Muhammed. Non-muslims can draw whatever they want.\n\nI understand there are people who do not agree with CH. I'm imploring you to explain to me why I'm incorrect in my support for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If anything I learn more towards socialist, but I cannot get behind the idea of inheritance tax. Society and sound government requires taxes and I think it's absolutely fair to have taxes on income, sales, purchases, whatever. But for government to come in when a dying person passes on their belongings or money to someone they care about and snatch away a piece of it is a step too far.\n\nI am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax. However since Spain is in recession it is extremely difficult to sell the house, and some people are forced to forfeit the property in order to be aligned with the law. This is not the basis of my belief, but it is what motivated me to post this to CMV.\n\nI want someone to give me a good reason to CMV since I think taxes are overall a positive thing. This is just one instance I think is outrageous.\n\n**TL; DR** I understand the need for and support taxation but I cannot support government interference in a dying person's gift to another person. CMV!\n\nEDIT: A few people are bringing up the situation in the US, where inheritance tax doesn't apply to amounts under 5 and a half million. That's fine. Well done USA. But just because it's adjusted and applied like that in the US doesn't make the concept any more agreeable when used throughout the rest of the world. I am not interested in talking about the US example if your argument is based around \"the US has this special set of circumstances and therefore the tax is ok\".\n_____\n\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: There will never be another military draft (forced conscription) in America.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_35gi8x", "selftext": "Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  \n\n1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  \n\n2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription\n\n3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.\n\n4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. \n\n5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.  \n\nPlease change my view!"}
{"title": "CMV: Reddit would be better without karma.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35ge2a", "selftext": "I know that /r/changemyview requires I add a few points here, but I don't really have anything besides this perception that every single thing reddit users complain about stems from karma. Reposting, karma whoring, overused memes, etc. People do it because they want attention, and karma allows them that attention. It feels like everything is about getting people to like what you say rather than allowing people to speak their minds freely. It becomes a social status war about pleasing the masses. My views on this matter are similar to my views on allowing racist free speech. Most censorship, even user controlled censorship, is bad. Better to allow those views to come to light and then have a civil debate on it to change that person's view. Honestly, I just want a website that can be a forum for discussion without making me feel like an asshole for having unpopular opinions. So reddit may be a great place for the people who agree with the generally more popular opinions, but karma allows people to drown out the unpopular ones before they even have a chance to be defended. They shut down discussion and it de-incentivizes people who may have a different perspective. It should be okay to disagree, but it doesn't feel like it is unless you're in a sub specifically devoted to that. That's why the subs that prevent you from seeing karma are so great. You can have a reasoned discussion without feeling like you'll be punished for having a different opinion. Your comments get pushed to the bottom if you disagree with anything that doesn't fit with popular opinions. It's disgusting and it makes me want to abandon the site as a whole. I feel safer talking to real people who express genuine intelligence and do not take debate personally rather than those who attack you for having a different perspective. It applies to *everything* controversial and I think the subs that block karma are the ones who understand exactly what I'm talking about. The downvote button is not supposed to be a disagree button, but it is anyway. And that's a problem.\n \nI guess I did have some reasoning lol hopefully it'll be enough to appease the mods...\n \nBut anyway, that's my view. I'm open to changing it, but keep in mind we may just have to agree to disagree. Which is okay with me, people are allowed to have different opinions. That's my entire point lol\n \nI welcome you to try and CMV! :)\n \nEdit: This view is mostly about comment karma and the system itself, not against a system of sorting the best content. As /u/RustyRook said, \"For a sub as popular and busy as [/r/Aww], it would be impossible for a user to view all the cuteness on offer.\" So I understand and recognize that an invisible point system may be necessary, but my view is that it should never be a public aggregate number. It should only be an invisible way of sorting good content. I think comments are the bigger issue, and I think that people would be less likely to downvote unpopular opinions if there was less emphasis on karma.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: The MIT should not have removed Walter Lewin's lectures as a result of the sexual harassment scandal", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35fsku", "selftext": "A few months ago, Walter Lewin, a very famous physicist and MIT professor was accused of sexually harassing a female student in an online course. The MIT carried out an investigation and determined that he was guilty, cutting ties with him and revoking his title as an emeritus professor ( http://tech.mit.edu/V134/N60/walterlewin.html ). Now, I think we can safely assume that the accusations were real and I'll even concede that revoking his title is an appropriate measure. \n\nNevertheless, I'd argue that the removal of his lectures is a nonsencial, knee-jerk reaction from the MIT to prevent *any* blemish on its reputation, perhaps from fear of criticism from certain groups. Maybe they thought that the harsher the measure, the better reaction they would obtain from the society.\n\nRemoving Walter Lewin's lectures is a non-sensical approach and can't be really justified. Are the lectures themselves sexual harassment? Of course not! Does this provide justice for the victim(s)? Not at all. This measure only makes it harder for students to access very good lectures that'll allow almost anyone to comprehend basic concepts of Physics. In fact, the lectures can be readily accessed through torrents or other webpages, so it's not like the MIT is \"erasing\" Walter Mit from the society just to provide some relief to victims or to protect their reputation.\n\nShould we start destroying Wagner's recors just because he was an anti-semitic? Or should we stop referencing Watson's articles just because he made racist statements? I don't think so. \n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: I'm anti abortion, and I feel like an asshole for being so.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_35foy9", "selftext": "WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The \"it's going to happen anyway\" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?\n\n\n\n\nOf those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"title": "CMV: Bernie Sanders would make a bad president, despite the fact that I agree with him often", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35eih0", "selftext": "Although I agree with many of his political stances, and hist critiques of the current system, I'm not entirely sure that he'd make a good president.  The way I see it, the job of the president of the United States is to represent the populous of the United States, and many of his more extreme views might appeal widely to a crowd on reddit, but are hardly representative of the entire political sphere of USA.   Even if he were to somehow win a majority vote, he would be as unpopular in the south as Lincoln was.\n\nFurthermore, in order to get anything accomplished as a president, he needs to work fairly closely with Congress, and his current stance of \"attack anyone who receives donations from rich people\" would prevent him from being able to play nicely.   Finally, I think that as a president, his laser focus on the social problems of America would prevent him from focusing on the other issues that the president must contend with.  The way he presents himself currently, it seems as though he sees it as his mission to attack the current system, which is not the position that the president should occupy.    \n\nFinally, as a 74 year old man, who will be 75 at the time of the election, I think the same critiques that applied to John McCain also apply to him - there's a fairly good chance that if he were elected, he would die, or become quite ill while still in office.  For these reasons, I think he'd be better situated trying to solve these social/political problems in a different capacity.\n\n**Edit**:  I've seen a lot of the same points being brought up over and over again trying to refute my points, rather than offering evidence as to why he'd make a good president.   So I think I'll clarify:   I think that a good president is someone that unifies the nation, not someone that divides it, or enforces his will upon it.   "}
{"title": "CMV: Suicide is the only logical option for me / someone in my situation.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35eed1", "selftext": "I'll describe as much as I can without giving away my identity.\nI have undergone in-depth analysis of my life over the last few years, and I have concluded that suicide is logical, at least for my situation.\n\nTo start with, I am a trans female. I underwent SRS (sex reassignment surgery) seven years ago, but I do not feel that medical science is advanced enough to cure my dysphoria to an acceptable extent - my physical appearance is just far too different from my inner self image.\n\nFor this reason, I have been unable to enjoy any aspect of my life. I have had numerous relationships, some short term, a couple of long term, but they have all felt \"forced\" - not at all natural and how I'd expect a relationship to be. As I never felt like myself, I could never really participate in the relationships in the way I'd like to - and more or less all of them ended for these reasons. To elaborate, I felt no real emotions - I told myself I was feeling them, because that's what I expected, but none of it was ever \"real\".\n\nThe rest of my life has followed similar patterns. It's as if I am looking at someone else's life through a window, never actually experiencing the feelings and emotions that I'd expect to feel. I am unable to experience most emotions - the only thing I feel is disappointment and frustration about my situation. Other than that, I just feel numb. Never excited, or happy.\n\nI have tried various avenues to make my life worthwhile. I have taken up hobbies, sought medical treatment for the dysphoria as well as counselling, various anti-depressants and SSRIs, etc. (despite the fact that I do not suffer from depression) all to no avail. I know what my life is missing and I know that it will not be possible to fix it, at least not within my lifetime.\n\nI am currently in a state of existing rather than living. I see no point in going through the motions of life, having a job, buying a house etc. I quit my fairly well paid job and took up some part time work for a small business. It's enough to pay the rent and bills, but not much more. It keeps me alive, and I have far more free time.\n\nI have no desire to continue to live like this. In everything I do, I come across obstacles that make me more and more frustrated. I faced problems in full time employment for various reasons - I never wanted to be there, I never felt 'rewarded' despite my high pay and I had disdain for authority. Some days I just wouldn't bother to go in, because I felt like I had better things to do. In my current situation, I have constant worry about my financial situation - having just enough money to survive, I face huge problems when the unexpected happens - such as the recent head gasket failure in my car, and faced with having to move yet again in the next month or two.\n\nIn addition, I find new things to reinforce my desire to leave this life on an almost daily basis. It seems like every news article I read gives me further disdain for the human race, for the world around me.\n\nThe simple fact is, I have absolutely no desire to be here. Therefore, the logical alternative is to put an end to my life.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"title": "CMV: In its current form, Snoo is not a very good logo for Reddit.", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_35cytn", "selftext": "For a social media site such as Reddit, a well-designed logo can be a great way to increase visibility and build recognition over the internet. Although Snoo has become associated with Reddit as the site grows, I believe there are several shortcomings with it when compared to logos of other social media sites/programs:\n\n* Snoo isn't evocative of Reddit's name or function. [Viewing Snoo out of context](http://marketingland.com/wp-content/ml-loads/2013/01/Reddit-Logo.jpeg), as an uninitiated viewer, does nothing to relate the concept of the site in any way. In contrast, the logo of [Twitter](https://g.twimg.com/Twitter_logo_blue.png), for example, effectively and subtly hints at the site's function. As a stylized songbird, it's easy to connect the words 'twitter' and 'tweets' to the sounds a bird makes. In addition, the short, simple messages of birds can also easily relate to the function of twitter. With Snoo, no such obvious connection exists. This could be forgiven if Snoo made some sort of connection to the name of Reddit, like how Facebook and Google+ contain letters, but again, no such connection exists.\n\n* Snoo is too complicated to be widely recognizable. [Simple, dynamic designs](http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/10-logo-design-tips/) are characteristic of good logos. The problem with Snoo is that it's too intricate to be as effective as the simple logos of Facebook, Pinterest, and even Digg. This problem becomes especially obvious when viewing icons on pages for quick sharing of links. [Take a look at this image](http://graphicdesignsinspiration.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Free-Social-Media-Icon-Sets-For-Designers-08.jpg). You have clean, simple logos like Google+, Skype, and Tumblr, before you get to Snoo's head. Once again, if you are unfamiliar with the logo as Reddit's, it's very difficult to guess what site it might be.\n\n* Snoo doesn't make use of any interesting or creative colors or designs. Facebook has its characteristic blue. Snapchat has its distinctive white-on-yellow. YouTube has its red. Reddit has a character in black outline with a white body, apart from two small red eyes. I believe that a distinctive color palette would draw more positive attention than its current form, which seems to fall under the radar to non-Redditors. It also makes a heavy use of negative space, which means it can be drastically and unintentionally altered from placing it on different backgrounds. \n\n* Finally, Snoo's upright orientation makes it difficult to place on social media buttons without altering it. [Take a look at another example of icon buttons](http://cdn.designsrazzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/free-flat-social-media-icons.jpg). Although some logos have their full titles truncated to fit into boxes, Snoo has to have its entire lower body removed in order to fit in the same space. While it does make for a more detailed logo on the site itself, its upright orientation harms its versatility when being displayed from elsewhere. The lack of consistency across platforms is another shortcoming of Snoo, in my opinion. \n\nOverall, I think an update of Snoo to help it fit in with logos of other social media websites, as well as a general aesthetic cleanup, would be great for Reddit in the long-term. To truly make Reddit into a more visible and popular website, a good, clean logo is important.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The concerns expressed by survivors are typically along the lines of death being tragic or death being a waste.  When someone is stuck in their own personal hell, however, people's reactions aren't nearly as dramatic.  They usually try to comfort the depressed person and often get so frustrated from the futility of it that they give up on them.  Often, the advice given is to not die.  Isn't this like looking for the forest through the trees?  Isn't there a greater tragedy than death right in front of them?\n\nAnother example is of what is considered dangerous.  Many situations are considered non-dangerous simply because they probably won't result in death.  For example, it's often argued that gender dysphoria isn't a serious condition because it doesn't directly result in death.  This is argued despite the fact that the condition renders many people unable to even want to live.\n\nI've brought up suicidal ideation twice, now.  People often kill themselves because they feel that their suffering negates the point of them living.  Society tells us that these people made irrational decisions, but did they really?  Is death really more important than suffering?\n\n\nEdit:  This question is meant to be about society rather than individuals.  I was inspired to make this topic after reading people's opinions on policies and laws.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

{"title": "CMV: People shouldn't make fun of Madonna for being old.", "delta_label": false, "name": "t3_35blwd", "selftext": "She can't control the fact that she gets older.  To me, she's an artist continuing her career and doing what she loves.  People make fun of her because they're used to seeing 20-year-old singers and young artists, but being a musician should be just like other careers; nobody would make fun of a 56-year-old lawyer, but when Madonna continues singing into her old age she gets made fun of for being a \"dinosaur\" and gets criticism for \"Trying to stay relevant\" by collaborating with Nicki Minaj.  **Of course she's trying to stay relevant.  All artists try to stay relevant.** It's how they make their living.  I just don't see anything wrong with Madonna continuing to perform into her 50s."}
{"title": "CMV: America's economy is destined to fail", "delta_label": true, "name": "t3_35bc4b", "selftext": "I'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. If I hadn't been able to get a 100k loan, I wouldn't be 100k in debt right now. I would've gone to a state school, and eventually appreciated that fact once I became more emotionally mature. Parents have a hard time letting their kid get a tattoo, but they let you get a HUGE loan on what is right now a big gamble? Please.\n\nNow, why is that relevant? Well, the economy IS doing well right now, but who exactly is in charge? A bunch of people who the future economy won't affect in the slightest. Since a large majority of millenials are bogged by debt, we can't afford to properly flourish the economy like we want to. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting to be more poor. Someone's going to get fucked.\n\nTechnology is rapidly advancing, and many of the low-income jobs new grads have been forced to take are about to become obsolete. As there is no general income implemented yet, a LOT of people are about to be broke. The only really essential jobs will be things automation can't accomplish, e.g. unpredictable jobs. Almost any job in existence will likely eventually be run by a machine, I can't think of one that can't, there are factories in Japan that do maintenance on themselves.\n\nAs an American, I don't know much about other nations, as school taught me exactly jack shit about them, but I have to wonder if they're in a similar boat. The model on which our economy is built rapidly becomes more out of date every minute. Eventually we WILL have to make changes, and I doubt those in power at the time will have the competence or open mindedness to do so.\n\nOf course, none of this mindset was helped by [this book](http://www.epi.org/publication/failure-by-design/).\n\nPlease, PLEASE someone change my view. I really don't want to live in this country if I'm destined to end up homeless after defaulting on my loans.\n\nAny ideas?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!
